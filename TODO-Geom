Redesign Shape Atlas API
========================

rect(dx,dy)
rect_at((xmin,ymin),(xmax,ymax))

Merge these into a single overloaded function.

A bounding rectangle is represented as a matrix, ((xmin,ymin),(xmax,ymax)).
The top level elements are referenced using bb[MIN] and bb[MAX].
Maybe use a record instead?
  {min:(xmin,ymin), max:(xmax,ymax)}
Then use bb.min and bb.max.

Maybe support a variant,
  rect{xmin=-inf,ymin=-inf,zmin=-inf,xmax=inf,ymax=inf,zmax=inf} = ...
which is useful for cropping along specified boundaries using `intersection`.

The final result is 3 overloadings of rect:
  rect(dx,dy)
  rect{min:(xmin,ymin), max:(xmax,ymax)}
  rect{xmin=-inf,ymin=-inf,zmin=-inf,xmax=inf,ymax=inf,zmax=inf}

First implement the rect_at_e variant.

Colour Atlas Data Structures
============================
An Intensity is a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.

A Colour comprises red, green and blue Intensities.
* just an RGB triple; that's what colour functions return.

A Colour Map is a function mapping an Intensity onto a Colour.
* just a function value
* {colour_map: f}
* eg, rainbow i = sHSV(i,1,1);

A 2D or 3D Intensity Field maps a point (x,y) or (x,y,z) to an Intensity.
* Could be a function.
* Could be a variant of Shape: {is_2d,is_3d,intensity}
  This type is viewable as graphics.

A 2D or 3D Colour Field maps a point (x,y) or (x,y,z) to a Colour.
If you compose a Colour Map with an Intensity Field you get a Colour Field.
* Could be a function.
* Could be a subtype of Shape: {is_2d,is_3d,colour}
  This type is viewable as graphics.
