Changes to Viewer:

I am attempting to maintain a persistent window size/location in the
Viewer structure.

Fix storage leaks.

Replace curv*.frag temp file with a global string variable.

Dead code removal (remove unneeded globals).

Replace globals with member variables.

Move source code to libcurv/geom/viewer
