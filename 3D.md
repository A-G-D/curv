# 3D Viewer
Goals:
* View a compact object (eg, a dodecahedron).
  * Orbit around the object, viewing it from all directions (left, right,
    above, below, front, back).
    * There is an origin and an eye point.
      By default, the origin is at the centre of the compact object.
      The eye direction is the vector from the eye point to the origin.
      We are using controls to orbit the eye point around the origin without
      changing the distance.
    * OpenSCAD does this using button 1 drag in 2 dimensions. The implementation
      using Euler angles is subject to gimbal lock.
    * My idea is: button 1 drag. When the button goes down, you are conceptually
      grabbing a point on the surface of the sphere whose origin is `origin`
      and whose radius is `magnitude(eye-origin)`. By dragging the mouse,
      you rotate this sphere using quaternions, by slerping the control point
      to the new location. No gimbal lock.
  * Zoom in and out. In OpenSCAD, you use the scroll wheel. The eye point
    zooms in and out without moving the origin. The eye/origin distance is
    being changed.
* Fly through an infinite lattice. Need controls to:
  * Translate the eye/origin pair (without changing the distance).
    * Move in and out along the eye direction.
      How about: CTRL + scroll wheel
    * Pan left/right/up/down.
      In OpenSCAD, this is button2 drag.
  * Rotate the viewing direction, keeping the eye point constant and moving
    the origin. (?)
* Zoom in on an infinitely detailed fractal surface.
  Using scroll wheel, as in the u_view2d/mandelbrot example.
  * In the 2D viewer, the camera origin is always embedded in the 2D plane,
    so zooming is uncomplicated.
  * In the 3D viewer, if we use the scroll wheel to zoom with OpenSCAD semantics
    then the position of the origin is critical, you can zoom in only so close
    without moving the origin to the surface of the object you want to zoom
    in on.
  * What does this do in terms of the camera model?
    Does the distance between eye and origin get shorter?
    Or am I decreasing the field of view?
* Roll the camera around the eye/origin axis?

Camera parameters:
* eye (ray origin), centre (ray target), camera roll, lens length.
```
mat3 camera = look_at(eye, centre, roll);\n"
vec3 rd = ray_direction(camera, p, lens);\n"
vec3 col = render( ro, rd );\n"
```

## Phase 0: Like OpenSCAD
To start with, the initial view won't depend on the shape's bounding box.
The initial camera parameters are hard coded.
The center is fixed at (0,0,0). Only the eye point and roll angle change.
We'll export these uniform variables:
* `mat4 u_camera3d`
* `vec3 u_eye3d`
Then:
```
vec3 rd = ray_direction(u_camera3d, p, lens);\n"
vec3 colour = render( m_eye3d, rd );\n"
```

# glslViewer uniform variables
Maybe I can use the glslViewer uniforms for my camera?
Hm, most of them are only set if there is a geometry file. That's fixable.
I'll document what these things are in the absence of geometry.

vec3 u_eye           -cam.getPosition() m_position
u_normalMatrix  cam.getNormalMatrix() m_normalMatrix
u_modelMatrix   model_matrix            4x4 identity matrix
u_viewMatrix    cam.getViewMatrix() m_viewMatrix
u_projectionMatrix  cam.getProjectionMatrix() m_ProjectionMatrix
u_modelViewProjectionMatrix
   with geom: cam.getProjectionViewMatrix() * model_matrix
   without geom: identity matrix

What is model, view, projection matrix?
* model matrix maps the local coordinates of an individual shape
  onto world coordinates (of a scene comprising multiple shapes)
* view matrix maps world coordinates to camera coordinates
* projection matrix maps camera coordinates to screen coordinates.
  Transform points from eye space to clip space. Returns a homogenous coordinate
  with a non-unity w value to implement perspective.
    if (m_type == CameraType::ORTHO) {
        m_projectionMatrix = glm::ortho(-1.5f * float(m_aspect), 1.5f * float(m_aspect), -1.5f, 1.5f, -10.0f, 10.f);
    } else if (m_type == CameraType::FREE) {
        m_projectionMatrix = glm::perspective(m_fov, m_aspect, m_nearClip, m_farClip);
    }

cam structure:
Camera cam;
float lat = 180.0;
float lon = 0.0;
struct Camera {
    // constructor:
        m_position([0,0,0]), m_orientation([0,0,0]), m_scale([1,1,1])
        m_aspect(4/3), m_fov(45), m_nearClip(.01), m_farClip(100), m_type(FREE)
    // Node
    glm::mat4   m_transformMatrix;
    glm::vec3   m_axis[3];
*   glm::vec3   m_position;
    glm::quat   m_orientation;
    glm::vec3   m_scale;
    // Camera
*   glm::mat4 m_projectionViewMatrix;
*   glm::mat4 m_projectionMatrix;
*   glm::mat4 m_viewMatrix;
*   glm::mat3 m_normalMatrix;
    double m_aspect;
    double m_fov;
    double m_nearClip;
    double m_farClip;
    enum{ORTHO,FREE} m_type;
}

How cam changes:
  init:
    cam.setViewport(getWindowWidth(), getWindowHeight());
     -> m_aspect=width/height;
        updateCameraSettings();
         -> update projectionMatrix, projectionViewMatrix, normalMatrix
    cam.setPosition([0,0,-3])
        m_position = pt;
  on button 1 drag:
    float dist = glm::length(cam.getPosition());
    lat -= getMouseVelX();
    lon -= getMouseVelY()*0.5;
    cam.orbit(lat,lon,dist);
    cam.lookAt(glm::vec3(0.0));
  on button 2 drag:
    float dist = glm::length(cam.getPosition());
    dist += (-.008f * getMouseVelY());
    if(dist > 0.0f){
        cam.setPosition( -dist * cam.getZAxis() );
        cam.lookAt(glm::vec3(0.0));
    }
  onViewportResize:
    cam.setViewport(_newWidth,_newHeight);

# 3D Shapes

2D and 3D shapes have different types.
* There are different previewers for 2D and 3D shapes.
* union(square,cube) is an error.

Polymorphic Operations:
* union is polymorphic across 2D and 3D shapes (like in OpenSCAD).
  As opposed to having union2 and union3.

everything and nothing
* Maybe they are polydimensional.
  * This allows union to be a monoid, even though it is polymorphic:
    union() yields nothing.
  * There is a single `make_shape` function that constructs 2D, 3D and
    polydimensional shapes.
  * If they are polydimensional, which previewer is used? 2D.
* Maybe they are split into everything2, nothing2, everything3, nothing3.
  * `shape2d` and `shape3d` are separate operations.

What is the representation of a polydimensional shape?
 1. Two separate representations for 2D and 3D.
    Eg, dist2, colour2, bbox2, dist3, colour3, bbox3.
 2. There is a 3D representation, and a polydimensional flag
    which causes the 3D representation to be collapsed to the XY plane
    to create the 2D representation when it is needed.
 3. Colour and Distance functions have [x,y,z] arguments for both the 2D,
    3D and Polydimensional cases. The z argument is ignored in 2D.
    Bbox2 and Bbox3 are distinct fields, and serve to mark whether the shape
    is 2D, 3D or both.
      everything = make_shape {
        distance p = -inf,
        bbox2 = [[-inf,-inf],[inf,inf]],
        bbox3 = [[-inf,-inf,-inf],[inf,inf,inf]],
      }
      _union2(s1,s2) = make_shape {
        dist p : min(s1.dist p, s2.dist p),
        colour p : if (s1.dist p <= 0) s1.colour p else s2.colour p,
        if (defined(s1.bbox2) && defined(s2.bbox2))
          bbox2 : [min(s1.bbox2'0, s2.bbox2'0), max(s1.bbox2'1, s2.bbox2'1)],
        if (defined(s1.bbox3) && defined(s2.bbox3))
          bbox3 : [min(s1.bbox3'0, s2.bbox3'0), max(s1.bbox3'1, s2.bbox3'1)],
      },
 4. boolean attributes `is_2d` and `is_3d`, and one bbox. The Z components
    of the bbox are 0/infinite/ignored in 2D objects.
      everything = make_shape {
        distance p = -inf,
        bbox = [[-inf,-inf,-inf],[inf,inf,inf]],
        is2d = true, is3d = true,
      };
      _union2(s1,s2) = make_shape {
        dist p : min(s1.dist p, s2.dist p),
        colour p : if (s1.dist p <= 0) s1.colour p else s2.colour p,
        bbox : [min(s1.bbox'0, s2.bbox'0), max(s1.bbox'1, s2.bbox'1)],
        is2d : is_shape2d s1 && is_shape2d s2,
        is3d : is_shape3d s1 && is_shape3d s2,
      };
      is_shape2d s = defined(s.is2d) && s.is2d;
      is_shape3d s = defined(s.is3d) && s.is3d;
