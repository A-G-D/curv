Curv is a programming language for creating art using mathematics.
It's a 2D and 3D geometric modelling tool that supports full colour,
animation and 3D printing.

Curv was originally inspired by OpenSCAD, but isn't compatible.
* It's a simple, powerful, pure functional programming language.
  Functions and shapes are first class values.
* There is a standard library of predefined geometric shapes and operators,
  inspired by OpenSCAD, but written entirely in the Curv language.
* Shapes are represented using Function Representation (F-Rep).
  They can be infinitely detailed, infinitely large, and any shape that
  can be described using math can be represented exactly.
* Shapes are rendered on a GPU using ray-marching. Curv code is compiled
  into GPU code.

The Curv project is in the initial development phase right now.

The current dev environment is Ubuntu 16.04. A Mac port is planned.
