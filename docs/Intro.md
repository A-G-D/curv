Curv is a programming language for creating art using mathematics.
<examples>

The Curv language is:

* A domain specific geometry description language.

* A declarative, pure functional language.

* Dynamically typed, with a small, fixed set of types.

* An expression language.
  Most programming languages have a 2- or 3- level syntax.
  In many cases, the "top level" of a source file is the "module" level, where
  there is a sequence of definitions. Inside of function definitions is the
  "statement" level, where there is a sequence of definitions and statements.
  Inside of statements are expressions that compute values.
  But in Curv, the top level of a source file is an expression.
