The Shape Atlas
===============
The Shape Atlas is a catalog of operations for constructing,
transforming and combining 2D and 3D geometric shapes.

This is a research project to identify, classify and implement
all of the artistically useful operations on signed distance fields
(the representation Curv uses for geometric shapes).

Each operation will be given an API, and sometimes we'll explore multiple
implementations with different tradeoffs.

The ultimate goal is to boil all of this research down into a well
designed, consistent and powerful geometry API for Curv, which will be
included in the Curv standard library.

2D and 3D Shapes:
  Every shape is marked as being 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, or both.
  2D shapes are embedded in the XY plane.
  (The only standard shapes that are both are ``everything`` and ``nothing``.)

Infinite and Degenerate Shapes:
  A shape can be infinite. Many shape constructors accept ``inf`` as a dimension argument.

  A 2D shape with no area, or a 3D shape with no volume, is called degenerate.
  Examples are geometric points, line segments or curves, and in 3D, surfaces with 0 thickness.

  Points and curves are invisible in the preview window.
  Infinite and degenerate shapes are useful as intermediates for constructing
  shapes, even though you can't 3D print them or export them to some file formats.

Colour:
  Shapes have volumetric colour.
  A function assigns a colour to each point in the interior and on the boundary
  of every 2D and 3D shape. Primitive shapes are assigned a default yellowish colour,
  which you change using the ``colour`` function.
  Shape operations must specify how the colour of the result shape derives from the
  colour of the argument shapes.
  (Colour assignment operators will be researched elsewhere, in a Colour Atlas document.)

Boolean (Set Theoretic) Operations
==================================
``nothing``
  A special shape, classified as both 2D and 3D,
  that contains no geometric points.
  It's the identity element for the ``union`` operation.

``everything``
  A special infinite shape, classified as both 2D and 3D,
  that contains all geometric points.
  It's the identity element for the ``intersection`` operation.

``complement shape``
  Reverses inside and outside, so that all points inside the argument
  shape are outside the result shape, and vice versa.
  But the boundary doesn't change.
  If the input is a finite shape, the output will be infinite.

``union (shape1, shape2, ...)``
  Construct the set union of a list of zero or more shapes.
  
  The colours of shapes later in the list
  take precedence over shapes earlier in the list.
  This follows the metaphor of ``union`` as an additive operation
  where later shapes are "painted on top of" earlier shapes.

  ``union`` is an associative operation with ``nothing``
  as the identity element, meaning it is a monoid.
  The empty list is mapped to ``nothing``.
  If all of the shapes have the same colour, then
  ``union`` is commutative.

``intersection (shape1, shape2, ...)``
  Construct the set intersection of zero or more shapes.
  
  The colour of the first shape takes precedence.
  This is the opposite of the ``union`` convention.
  It follows the metaphor of ``intersection`` as a subtractive operation
  where the first shape is primary, and subsequent shapes indicate which parts of
  the primary shape not to remove.
  It is consistent with the traditional definition
  of ``difference(s1,s2)`` as ``intersection(s1,complement(s2))``.

  ``intersection`` is an associative operation.
  The empty list is mapped to ``everything``.
  If all of the shapes have the default colour,
  then ``everything`` is the identity element,
  and ``intersection`` is commutative and a monoid.
  
``difference (shape1, shape2)``
  A binary operation that subtracts shape2 from shape1,
  preserving the colour of shape1.

``symmetric_difference (shape1, shape2, ...)``
  The result contains all of the points that belong to exactly one shape in the list.
  
  This is an associative, commutative operation with ``nothing`` as its identity element.
