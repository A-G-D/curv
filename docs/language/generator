A list constructor contains a comma-separated list of element constructors.
An element constructor is a phrase that specifies a sequence of zero or more
values.

A statement is an element constructor (in a list constructor),
or a field constructor (in a record constructor) or a debug action.

List comprehensions
  The expressions in a simple list constructor are a special case of *element generators*.
  An element generator is a phrase that specifies a sequence of zero or more values.
  You can use iteration, conditionals, and local variables.
  A list constructor that uses the more general syntax is called a list comprehension.
