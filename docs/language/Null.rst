Null
----
``null`` is a placeholder value that, by convention, indicates that
some situation does not hold, and that the corresponding value is not available.
Its distinguishing characteristic is that it is different from any other value.
The only available operation is testing a value to see if it is null.

``value==null``
  true if the value is null, otherwise false.

``is_null value``
  true if the value is null, otherwise false.
