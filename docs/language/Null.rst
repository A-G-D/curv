Null
----
``null`` is a placeholder value that, by convention, indicates that
some situation does not hold, and that the corresponding value is not available.
Its distinguishing characteristic
is that it is different from any other value. The only available
operation is testing a value to see if it is null: ``value==null``
is true if the value is null, otherwise false.
