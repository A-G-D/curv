The Core Language
=================

* Simple, elegant, powerful.
* Dynamically typed.
* Pure functional language. No I/O. Programs are expressions.
* Curried functions, patterns, list/record/string comprehensions.
* Array language: scalar arithmetic operations work on vectors, matrices and higher dimensional arrays.
* 7 data types: the 6 JSON types, plus function values.
* Superset of JSON. Curv is a data interchange format for pure functional data.
