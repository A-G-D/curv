Documentation
=============

The user interface is the ``curv`` program. After building and installing ``curv``, use ``curv --help`` for command line options.

There is no language documentation, but you can look at ``examples/*.curv`` and ``lib/std.curv`` to see working curv code.

Try this::

  $ curv examples/shreks_donut.curv

Try this::

  $ curv
  curv> 2+2
  4
  curv> cube 1
