Colour Fields
=============

A colour field is a function mapping each point in 2D or 3D space onto a `colour value`_.
The colour field function also has a time parameter, so colour fields can optionally be animated.

Every `shape`_ has a colour field, which defines the shape's colour pattern when it is rendered.
