// The convex, symmetrical polyhedra:
//    5 Platonic solids
//   13 Archimedean solids
//   13 Catalan solids (duals of the Archimedean)
//   92 Johnson solids
//
// Support all of these as parameterized polyhedra.
// Provide operations for transforming polyhedra into other polyhedra.
// - wireframe() converts a polyhedron to a wireframe,
//   so you can make this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:282868
// - stellate()
// - Conway polyhedron notation is used to describe polyhedra based on
//   a seed polyhedron modified by various operations. Can make a large
//   number of polyhedra beginning the the Platonics.

// - George Hart's extensions to Conway's operators.
//
// A polyhedron object contains 'metadata' to support the operations,
// but also contains its own geometry, so it can be rendered directly.
//
// OpenSCAD2 uses lazy evaluation.
// 1. This file will define the Platonic solids as name = solid.
//    It will also define the archimedean and catalan solids as Conway
//    operations on the Platonics. Due to laziness, you won't pay the cost
//    of evaluating Conway operators for bindings you don't reference.
// 2. Each polyhedron contains its own geometry. But due to lazy evaluation,
//    that doesn't cost anything if the object isn't rendered.
