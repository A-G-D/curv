Runsun wrote this interesting tool for making polyhedra:

It's called 'faces'. Basically, it takes responsibility for constructing
a polyhedron with a particular topological structure by generating a 'faces'
array for that structure. The vertices are specified independently.
Then 'faces' and 'vertices' are passed to polyhedron().
