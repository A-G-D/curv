Should I use Vulkan?

macOS support is missing.

The Vulkan Portability Initiative
https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-announces-the-vulkan-portability-initiative
will deliver a subset of Vulkan that runs on all modern platforms,
including macOS/Metal and Windows/Direct X 12.

Wait for this.
* Might eventually work better on Mac than OpenGL, which is not being updated.
* Written in Rust, exports C API.

Wait until most people have Vulkan capable GPUs.
The Steam hardware survey is one way to gauge this.

Vulkan has a higher level of functionality.
So I can rely on a larger set of capabilities, without writing
platform dependent code.

If I compile Curv into SPIR-V, does this speed up shader/compute
kernel compilation?
* with Vulkan Portability, that might be platform dependent.

Vulkan seems to unify graphics and general purpose compute.
So I'm not targetting both OpenGL and OpenCL, just Vulkan.

The Vulkan API is super complex, so I may need to use middleware.
