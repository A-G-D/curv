Olah says:
(NB. This particular formation of rounded unions is a little bit naive. If you
union and the sides arenâ€™t orthogonal, this version will make a bump, which is
not the expected behavior. This can be corrected for quite easily by looking at
the dot product of the discrete gradients.)

But ImplicitCAD doesn't implement this idea.

rmin (r, x, y) = (
    if (abs (x-y) < r)
        y + r*sin(pi/4+asin((x-y)/r/sqrt 2)) - r
    else
        min(x,y)
);

    dist(x,y,z,t) = rmin(1, x, y),
