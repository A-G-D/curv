Sea of Nodes is a kind of SSA-like compiler IR.

Authors claim their IR is lightweight, easy to code fast optimizations in C++.

The main idea is that control flow dependencies are explicit, rather than
implied by a total ordering on statements. And this makes certain optimizations
easier to write. But final code generation is more difficult, since you have
to impose a total ordering.
