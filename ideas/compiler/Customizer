Compiling a Parametric Shape into GLSL
======================================
Let's say that S is a parametric shape with parameter and call fields.
How to compile the function S.call into GLSL?
Need to partially evaluate S.call before generating GLSL.
Alternatives:
 1. Use the evaluator.
    * Create a parameter record A (a Value). Parameters that have a picker
      get a Reactive Value as their argument. Non-picker parameters get a
      proper value taken from S.parameter.
    * Evaluate S.call(A).
    * The result must be a shape record S1 (otherwise error).
    * GL compile S1.dist and S1.colour into GLSL. References to reactive
      values are converted to uniform variable references.

    Expressions containing uniform variables are evaluated to thunks, as in
    lazy evaluation, but subexpressions that don't contain uniform variables
    are evaluated to constants, as in partial evaluation, so that the thunks
    don't need to capture non-local variables.

    In the resulting shape value, the dist and colour functions will capture
    non-local variables containing reactive values, and thunks containing the
    same. The bbox field will depend on shape parameters, so it becomes a thunk.

    It's a big change that affects every Operation class.

 2. Add an 'abstract evaluator' pass.
    * cons:
      * Code duplication with the evaluator?
      * How in detail does the abstract evaluator work?
    * pros: the run-time state for a partial evaluator might ideally be
      different from the regular evaluator? I wonder if the evaluator strategy
      leads to a lot of large independent thunks containing large common
      subexpressions. So a separate partial evaluator could be more efficient?

The evaluator approach can be extended to support a form of Functional Reactive
Programming (FRP) where time-varying external inputs, like real-time audio
or video signals, are represented in Curv as global Reactive variables. In
the GPU, these are mapped to GLSL uniform variables.

The Abstract Evaluator (compile time) approach was originally intended to
extend the expressiveness of the GL subset, to partially evaluate subexpressions
and to discard unneeded subexpressions that can't be compiled to GL.

Maybe the code required for all these features can be unified into the
evaluator. The reactive evaluator and the abstract evaluator have things in
common, similar data structures and algorithms:
* Abstract values are represented by expression trees (annotated by types)
  or by proper values.
* Partial evaluation.
* 'is_num X', where X is an abstract value of type Num, evaluates to true.

Compiler changes to support the Customizer
==========================================
The main interface to the GLSL compiler takes a shape as an argument,
and outputs a set of GLSL definitions.
    void glsl_export(const Shape_Program& shape, std::ostream& out)

GL compile a parametric shape + picker patterns
into a set of GLSL definitions + uniforms
using the GL abstract evaluator.

A parametric shape is distinguished by two fields:
* `call` is a function mapping a parameter record to another instance of the
  same shape family. The argument has a record pattern, and within the record
  pattern, each individual field:
  * may have a predicate pattern, where the predicate may be a picker.
  * has a default value that matches the `parameter field below.
* `parameter` is a record of default parameter values, matching the record
  pattern in the `call` function.

If we are GL compiling a shape that has the `call` and `parameter` fields,
but they aren't valid as a parametric record, we issue a warning
and compile the shape as non-parametric.

Picker predicates cause the GL compiler to assign uniform variables to the
corresponding parameters. There is a GL compile error if the resulting code
is not GL compatible, which goes away if you remove the annotation.

The GL compiler recognizes parametric shapes. The parameters of `call`
which have picker predicates are mapped to uniform variables, while non
annotated parameters are replaced by their default values.

The GL compiler compiles the body of the call function into an abstract
record value, parameterized by uniforms defined by the parameter record,
using abstract evaluation.

This abstract record value is then recognized as an abstract shape value,
and we output each shape field as a top level GLSL definition.
And we also output uniform variable definitions.

* checkbox a -- a is a boolean value, use checkbox picker.
* slider(i,j) a -- a is a number between i and j inclusive, use slider picker.

Compiler Changes
----------------
I'd like the ability to output an 'inf' const definition.
In GLSL 4.1, it's technically legal to write
    const float inf = 1.0 / 0.0;

I could dynamically figure out the OpenGL version requirement during
compilation. I could compare the version requirement to the OpenGL version
advertised by the GPU driver, and issue a warning or error if the driver
is too primitive to support the requested shape.

I haven't found a good reason to begin a GLSL program with #version.
If I don't use it, I just get the latest version supported by the compiler,
and errors on lines of GLSL that use unsupported features. #version moves
the error so that the driver can complain about an unsupported version on the
first line, at the GLSL #version line.

While compiling a function, we may generate prerequisite definitions.

The output of the first phase of GL compilation is a data structure, consisting
of a list of top-level definitions, with their values represented by IR trees.
An ordered list that encodes dependency ordering, maybe.
Then we traverse the data structure and output GLSL text.

An IR tree is just an Operation tree. It's good to have a single intermediate
compiler representation that can be used across multiple compiler passes.

I've considered whether the IR representation can be unified with Values.
Possible antecedents are: Lisp "programs are data structures" (only in a weak
sense), and Mathematica symbolic evaluation. This idea is premature, but good
to consider for the long term, if it leads to a simpler and more powerful
system. Right now, it's better to mimic a conventional compiler.

Requirements for the IR.
* Expression nodes optionally have a GL type, which is propagated using
  type inference.
* Partial evaluation / constant folding / function call inlining.
* Expression nodes have a `simplify` method that performs partial evaluation,
  constant folding, etc. Function values have an optional `simplify` method
  that maps an argument Expression to a simplified version of the function
  call. If the argument is a Const, then we `call` the function instead.
* Not all function calls need to be inlined. If a function has a GL type,
  then we could emit a function definition and call it out-of-line.
* Pattern matching works on Expression arguments during function call inlining.
* I can print an IR tree, so that I can debug what the simpifier is doing.

Simplify: Phase 1 of GL Compiler
--------------------------------
This phase transforms the program into statically typed procedural code
(aka GLCode), not yet specialized into GLSL or C++.
* Performs GL type checking, attaches optional GL types to Expression nodes.
* Performs code transformations that eliminate untyped expressions.
    Inline expand calls to untyped functions.
    {a:x}.a => x
    (x,y,z)[0] => x
    make_shape{...} => GLCode record
* This phase could be extended to a full optimization pass. That is not
  required for the Customizer.

Input: a function value (eg, dist or colour function).
Output: a GLCode function definition, plus auxiliary definitions.

Input: a parametric record.
Output: a GLCode record, plus auxiliary definitions, incl. uniform variables.

Need a data structure that collects top level definitions.

What does the GLCode for a record look like?
* Currently, I have a Record_Expr, and a Module_Expr abstract class.
  These could also occur as the body of a Preaction_Op or a Block_Op.
  There will also be Const(record_value) nodes.

How do I recognize a GLCode record?
* Maybe there is a type() function on expression nodes. There could be a
  record type that contains a set of (fieldname,type) pairs.

How do I extract a field named F from a GLCode record EXPR?
* In the general case, one could create a new Dot(EXPR,F) expression,
  then simplify it. This would include dead code elimination.
* In a realistic example, the body of a parametric record will compile into
  a GLCode expression of type record, with shape fields. We want to extract
  the 'dist' and 'colour' fields, which will not be constant values, but
  expression trees that share common subexpressions. There won't be a way to
  share code (except if we can emit common function definitions called by
  both trees, to be considered later).
