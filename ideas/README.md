The `ideas` directory contains brainstorming, exploration of design
alternatives, and research about possible future directions.

For project documentation, please visit the `docs` directory instead.

Here's an outline of my design process:
 1. I start by designing the most ambitious / powerful / complete / awesome
    solution to the problem. At this stage, I'm thinking outside the box.
    I'm not writing code, and I am not worried about difficulty
    and implementability. I am designing without fear.
 2. Then I enter the implementation phase. At this point, I simplify (eliminate
    needless complexity). I reframe or modify powerful ideas from the first
    phase to make them easier to implement. I look for the "minimum viable
    product" so that I have a starting point for writing code. I use an
    agile coding methodology where I create a very small but functional
    program then incrementally extend it until it does what I need.

Be aware that there are a lot of rejected ideas in here.
It's messy, but this is the process by which I weed through alternative designs
to find the best ones.
