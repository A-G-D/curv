Curv is:

* A creative coding / live coding platform for creating 2D and 3D graphics.

* A domain specific programming language for generating 2D and 3D graphics.

* A data structure and file format
  for representing and distributing 2D and 3D geometric objects,
  using volumetric representation with signed distance fields.

* A platform for advanced 3D printing.

I will also describe the underlying technology, "signed distance fields".
I'll explain why it is better suited for parametric design and 3D printing
than the conventional technology used in most 3D CAD and sculpturing programs,
and why recent advances in GPUs have made the technology more practical.
