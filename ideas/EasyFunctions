* Better error messages for bad function calls.
* In CLI, `help <function>` prints usage info for a function.

'f a b c' is a function call with 3 arguments.
Error message mentions name of function and ordinal number of bad argument,
and gives required type of argument if a parameter pattern is available.
* Too few arguments: currying returns a function, later function is used in
  non-function context. At this point, we can report a missing argument.
* Too many arguments: a non-function is used in the function position of a
  function call. If the non-function expression is a function call, then
  report too many arguments.

The goal is to improve the user experience and get better error messages.
* If a function already uses pattern matching to restrict parameters to their
  actual type, then this proposed mechanism can improve error messages for
  calls to that function. But getting proper annotation for all the functions
  in the standard library is a big challenge in itself.
  * The `rotate` function. How to get good error messages for a bad first
    argument? The first parameter has no pattern, but in the function body,
    it is piped into `match`.
  * Type inference, soft typing, gradual typing.
    * This also contributes to function help.
  * Domain error inheritance: a kind of dynamic type inference on func params.
    In function f, if a parameter x of f is passed as an argument to function g,
    and g reports a domain error on x, then a domain error is reported by f.
    * This does not contribute to function help, and is not semantically a
      pattern match failure in f's parameter pattern.
* The `help` command becomes a tool for checking how well a function is
  annotated, either explicitly or by type inference.
* Internally, we need a mechanism for using a function's annotations to generate
  good error messages when an argument fails to pattern match.
  At_Arg (Context class) contains the function name and argument position.

How does At_Arg know the function name and argument position?
 1. It contains the frame, which contains the call_phrase.
    If function 'f' has a function argument 'g', the name 'g' is used
    in an error message for a bad call to 'g' within the body of 'f'.
    [This is the style of a compile time type error.]
 2. It contains the function value, which contains function name and argpos.
    This is run-time information.

How does `help` know the function's usage info?
 1. The info is in the function value.

Function value contains:
* Symbol name_; // optional name, Symbol is a nullable type
* int argpos_; // # args previously applied, for a partial application.

Builtin functions like `sin` have a name assigned a priori.
User defined functions have a name is assigned at compile time.
A function definition of the form `f x y z = ...` or `f = x->y->z->...`
adds name metadata to the Lambda_Phrase.
* future extension: m = {f x = ...;} -- the function is named m.f, not just f.

Unary/Binary Arithmetic Operations: x+y, sqrt x, etc
----------------------------------------------------
These are tensor operations, so a domain error might be due to a bad tensor
element. For binary ops, a domain error might occur because two tensors are
incompatible, not just because an argument or element is not a tensor.
So, in general case, need to show both arguments.

Error message displays the bad run-time value, which I put at the end
in case it is large.

Error messages for binary ops. Stack frame uses clang-style source text
underlining, with a caret under the operator.

    ERROR: domain error: 1+true
    1| x+y
       -^-

Error messages for named functions.

    ERROR: argument #1 of sqrt: is not a number: true
    1| sqrt true
            ^^^^

    ERROR: argument #1 of sqrt: domain error: -1
    1| sqrt (-1)
            ^^^^

Examples
--------
curv> help rotate
  rotate <rotation> <shape>
    <rotation> is one of:
      angle
      {angle, axis}
      {from: v1, to: v2}

From elm-lang.org:
    The 1st argument to function `join` is causing a mismatch.

    4|  String.join 42 ["Alice", "Bob"]
                    ^^
    Function `join` is expecting the first argument to be:

        String

    But it is:

        number

Example: 'cube >> colour "red"'
ERROR: argument "red" has no matching pattern in switch
file "/usr/local/bin/../lib/std.curv", line 1329(column 18)
  colour c shape = c >> match [
                   ^           
file "/usr/local/bin/../lib/std.curv", lines 1329(column 18)-1350(column 1)
  colour c shape = c >> match [
                   ^-----------
line 1(columns 1-20)
  cube >> colour "red"
  ^-------------------

A better error message would indicate that the first argument to function
'colour' is bad.
