Claims of the power and elegance of Geometric Algebra
as a way to describe and transform shapes.

relevance: once New Curv is ready, implement this as a library.

Two people who are promoters and popularizers of this new way to make shapes:

Versor and Pablo Colapinto
  He's an artist who does 3D graphics, as well as mathematician and academic.

  A versor is a generalization of a transformation matrix that can describe
  twists and other cool things.
