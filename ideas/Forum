mailing list/forum software
---------------------------
Find a replacement for Google Groups.

Goal is to support both a mailing list and a web forum interface, with both
treated as first class citizens.
 * The email interface needs to be good: readable subject lines,
   readable message bodies, containing the subject and text of the message
   with minimal boilerplate. Forum threads become email threads in your
   mail reader. Replying to a post creates a thread on the forum.
 * The forum UI needs to be good, at least as good as as a threaded mail
   reader. Easy to browse, find and submit posts. Rich text, embedded images.
 * Good admin interface, good spam filtering. First new post from a unique
   email address is quarantined until that address is approved for posting.

The data model for the forum is:
 * One or more lists/channels/rooms, initially just the one, but with room
   for expansion later.
 * Within a channel, there are posts, with subject lines and bodies, with
   discussions threaded by subject line.
   Rich text, ideally Markdown, and embedded images are supported.
   Replying to a post creates a thread.
 * You can subscribe to a channel via email, it behaves exactly like
   a mailing list.

I currently use Google Groups. Problem: not open source, and it's google.
The fact that it's google limits the set of people willing to sign up.
Otherwise it is fine.

Alternative software:
Someone's list: https://producingoss.com/en/message-forums.html
Not suitable:
 * sympa.org: no web forum, just readonly web archive
 * dadamailproject.com: no web forum
People are confused about:
 * Discourse. Forum UI is very complex, featureful, configurable, popular.
   https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-vs-email-mailing-lists/54298
     "With properly configured incoming mail, Discourse can be used just like
     a mailing list. If you’ll be interacting with Discourse exclusively by
     email, consider enabling Mailing list mode in your personal preferences,
     provided it’s enabled on your forum." (Not actually true.)
   And you can import from Google Groups.
   And there is a mobile client.

   But: Tried mailing list mode once, and found it unusable.
   Even Jeff Atwood says: mailing list mode forces an email on every single
   post, forever. It’s “nightmare difficulty”, or “the nuclear option”.
   https://meta.discourse.org/t/apply-mailing-list-mode-per-category/47772/16
   This thread explains why Discourse is not suitable for migrating from a
   mailman instance. It's not designed to support mailing lists.
Possibly suitable:
 * Zulip 3. The Zulip data model matches the email data model: each message
   has a subject line, contents, belongs to a thread. The Zulip project
   lists "mirroring mailing list traffic" as a supported use case, and the
   docs for configuring this look plausible. Still need: testimonials about
   how well this works, what the problems are.
    * Is zulip a good replacement for google groups?
      Weirdly, "zulip-announce" is on google groups.
    * Although Zulip has "email integration", it does not appear to have
      high quality mailing list integration. There is an open issue
      for Mailman integration: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/959
 * Mailman 3.
   eg, https://lists.mailman3.org/archives/list/mailman-users@mailman3.org/
   Installing on Ubuntu 20.04 requires following a mailing list post,
   manually fixing bugs in Python code.
 * groupserver.org
   Supposedly like google groups. Is there image support?
 * groups.io is not open source, but is free for open source projects and
   has github integration and markdown support. It is marketed as an upgrade
   from mailman and google groups.
 * dfeed : https://github.com/CyberShadow/DFeed
   Forum UI initially looks pretty good, and seems there is no compromise
   on mailing list support. Written in D, only used by D community.
 * HyperKitty (https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/) is a "modern forum"
   web user interface for mailman. It is GPL free software from the FSF and
   Fedora uses it. But it is plain text only: no rich text, markdown, or
   embedded images. https://gitlab.com/mailman/hyperkitty/-/issues/225

Zulip is currently my top pick. It is often proposed as an alternative to
Slack on the FoC forum. The pro-Zulip evangelism arguments seem compelling.
  "Combines the immediacy of real-time chat with the productivity benefits
  of a threaded conversation model"
A non-aligned FoC member who needs to use both says it is neither better nor
worse than Slack, just different.
