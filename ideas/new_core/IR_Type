IR Types are finite. There are no recursive types.
(This makes type equivalence easy to compute.)

Every Curv Value has an IR type.

There are different *kinds* of types, depending on how easy the value is to
represent in the GPU runtime environment.

A singleton type contains a single value, and occupies no storage.
Type equivalence is determined by IR value equality (which works on functions).

A monomorphic type has a value that exists at GPU runtime.

Values with polymorphic type only exist during IR evaluation.
A polymorphic type is either a polymorphic function type, or a compound type
containing an element with polymorphic type.

Take a look at Apple's WSL language for some ideas about the type system.

 * shader entry point arguments:
    * no structs.
    * opaque texture, opaque sampler, slices holding scalars, vectors, matrices
      or structs of these (recursively).
    * specialization constants: scalar; declared as 'specialized'
 * each type has an addressSpace, one of: constant, device, threadgroup, thread
 * WSL data types:
   * pointers (no pointer arithmetic)
   * array references (bounds-checked fat pointer to an array)
   * array, which has type and size
   * struct
   * bool
   * 32 bit numbers: uint, int, float
   * vector types: vector<basetype, size> where basetype is bool|uint|int|float
     and size is 2|3|4
   * matrix types: matrix<basetype,rows,cols> where basetype is bool|float,
     rows is 2|3|4, cols is 2|3|4. Note, no int or uint matrix types (could be
     added later).
   * samplers, type 'sampler'
   * textures: 1D|2D|3D, only in constant|device address space.

Functions:
* A monomorphic function value belongs to a singleton type.
  The parameter and result both have monomorphic types.
* How are monomorphic curried functions assigned types?
  I want 'F :: mtype1 -> mtype2 -> mtype' to be a monomorphic type.
  What is the type of 'F x', where 'x :: mtype1' is a GPU runtime nonconst
  value? Logically, it has type 'mtype2 -> mtype', which is a monomorphic type
  but not a singleton type. The state associated with an instance of this type
  has type 'mtype1', and for the case of 'F x', the state is 'x'.
* If F is the curried monomorphic function shown above, then the type of F
  is Function[F,0], with state []. The type of 'F x' is Function[F,1] with
  state [x].
* A polymorphic function is one that can't be assigned a monomorphic type.

Lists:
* A list where all of the elements have the same monomorphic type
  has type List(elemtype, count). Such a list can be indexed with a runtime
  value.
* A list where the elements have two or more distinct types
  has type Tuple[etype1,etype2,...]. Such a list can only be indexed with a
  compile time value.
* As a special case, [] has type Tuple[]: a singleton type with no state.
* What about lists where the number of elements varies at run time?
  Image and Mesh values in Curv would have this property.
  There are ways to model this on the GPU (textures and buffers).
