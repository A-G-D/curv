IR_Value is a node in an IR expression tree, representing a value.
The SC compiler compiles expressions into IR_Value trees.
We optimize the tree, then finally output GLSL.

During the initial implementation phase, there is a two way conversion between
SC_Value and IR_Value. Finally, SC_Value is phased out.

Optimizations:
* common subexpression elimination CSE
* constant evaluation
* peephole optimizations, operation specific

Methods:
* type()
* is it a constant? if so, what is the value?
* hash(), for CSE
* scope() index, for CSE
* emit(): output GLSL or C++
