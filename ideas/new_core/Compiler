The input to the compiler is either a function, or a record.
If it's a record, we compile all of the functions referenced by record fields.
By compiling multiple functions together, any external functions referenced
by two target functions are compiled once into a shared representation.
Eg, compile a dist function and a colour function.

The output from the compiler is an IR module, a set of named functions and
named external data definitions.
