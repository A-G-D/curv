This is the new (2019) compiler that translates a statically typed subset
of Curv (SubCurv) into a low-level language or executable format.
Possible targets include:
 * GLSL, now, for rendering shapes in a preview window.
 * WGSL, later, the WebGL shader language.
 * C++, now, for converting shapes to a mesh.
 * WASM, eg for generating meshes in a web browser, later
 * LLVM IR code (very speculative)

The main benefits of the new compiler:
 * Simpler source code that is easier to maintain.
   Eliminates massive boilerplate and massive case analyses.
 * Supports a much larger subset of Curv. More supported types (records),
   and partial evaluation of dynamic code that can't be statically typed.
 * Optimization, producing smaller/faster GLSL code.

The new compiler works by translating a Curv value (normally a function value)
into low level intermediate representation (IR), which is a tree of nodes.
The IR is optimized, then finally translated to the target language.

To avoid code duplication in the support for reactive values,
the IR is a subset of the interpreter's executable format, which means
for now that IR nodes are Operation objects. A Reactive_Expression contains an
IR node. (Aug 2020: this eliminates code duplication in the `dot` function.)
* To SC compile a function, we evaluate the function body, with the parameters
  defined as reactive variables. The function body is partially evaluated,
  and the result is a reactive expression containing IR as residual code.
  (Then we optimize the IR.)

I may implement this incrementally, as a new API that coexists with the old
compiler, until the new compiler is complete.
