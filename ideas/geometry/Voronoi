I'm looking for a compact and efficient "data structure representation"
of a distance field (DFD).
* Efficient distance function evaluation (on a GPU).
  You can get Euclidean distance and gradient at any point in space.
* Convert mesh to a DFD. High triangle count approximations are mapped to
  more compact DFDs that preserve the essential features of the mesh.
  It's a good intermediate representation for remeshing; see:
  http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-12-spring/LectureSlides/13_Remeshing1.pdf
* Convert DFD to a mesh. Produces high quality mesh, as in remeshing paper above
* Convert distance function to a DFD.
* Use DFD as a file format.

A DFD can somehow describe vertices, edges, curved and flat surfaces. These are
features we need to recognize for high quality mesh generation. (Now it sounds
like a boundary representation, but boundary recovery is a requirement.)

What primitives are DFDs built from?

What kinds of curves can be directly represented?
(In the remeshing paper, what kinds of curves are recovered from a mesh?)
- The conventional answer is: algebraic/polynomial curves,
  if we are representing curves as data instead of as code.

Voronoi

"Distance fields and Voronoi diagrams are closely related and one can be
efficiently computed from the other."
- really? That sounds true for polytopes. Is there enough information in a
  Voronoi diagram to recover a curved surface? What's the Voronoi diagram
  for an ellipse?
- I think the Voronoi diagram/skeleton of a SDF captures
  vertex and edge information, not curvature.

Base DFD on Voronoi diagram of a distance field?
Voronoi diagrams are also used in remeshing; see above link.

Maybe I want a GVD, Generalized Voronoi Diagram (of some variety).

"One can define Voronoi diagrams as the interference pattern of a propagating
wavefront*. The wavefront is an offset curve that is based on Minkowski sums
with disks of a fixed radius. The wavefront grows everywhere at unit speed.
* Sometimes called Grassfire model.
