=============
Project Goals
=============

GUI:
* 3 pane GUI, built with Qt
* sliders, to interactively tweak shape parameters

Import/Export:
* 'sharp' mesh export (eg, Dual Contouring)
* 'fractal' mesh export
* import image, voxels, mesh

Language:
* new geometry compiler: emit optimized GLSL, larger GL subset
* packages & package manager

Shape Library:
* better library support and tutorials for important techniques

Long Term
---------
* import/export
  * STL export: high quality (Dual Contouring or equiv.), GPU accelerated
  * export SVG
  * export as JSON CSG tree, for compatibility with other CSG systems
  * import images, animated GIFs, videos
  * offline conversion of triangle mesh to F-Rep, for import
  * import resource via URL
* GUI
  * an integrated IDE, like OpenSCAD, with Book-of-Shaders style editor
  * node based visual programming?
* programming language integration via libcurv: JavaScript, Python, Scheme
