# Name Of This Software

The key thing I'm building is an integrated geometry kernel and VM for a
programming language. The integration is needed because of F-Rep: a model is
represented by VM code, and the VM is special because it can run on an FPU
as well as on a CPU.
* ShapeVM -- available, 62 hits
* Morphix -- taken by several free software projects
* Vril
* FoRGE: Functional Representation Geometry Engine, or FoRGE VM
* the Ki geometry engine (sumerian earth goddess)

On top of the kernel/VM is a language and a GUI, initially like OpenSCAD.
* TeaCAD, *.tcad - 3440 hits
* Robo, *.robo, powered by Vril
* the Enki language, powered by Ki (sumerian language god)

Pick a brand name Foo, then generate names like FooVM, FooScript, FooCAD.
* FractalVM, FractalScript, FractalCAD. Name reflects the ability to create
  awesome amounts of internal complexity cheaply.
* name of a famous geometer?
  Thales, Pythagorus, Plato, Euclid, Archimedes,
  da Vinci, Descartes, Pascal, Newton, Euler, Mobius,
  Rvachev.
* Functional Geometry: *.fg, FG Engine, FG Language (FGL), FG Designer,
  github.com/doug-moen/functional_geometry/{engine,language,designer}
* Qurve
* Curv: *.curv, Curv Engine, Curv Language, Curv Designer,
  CurvM, CurvL, CurvD, curvi CLI.
  The name suggests the kind of thing that you are designing and rendering,
  and points at one benefit of F-Rep, the ability to model arbitrary curves.

possible names for this software:
* TeaCAD -- file extension .tcad, successor of .scad
* Red Mercury
* MathScape -- *.math

  Rationale: name is more general than CAD; I want to support both art and
  engineering, 3D solids but also 2D pictures.
