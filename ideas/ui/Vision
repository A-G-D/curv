Here are some interesting embeddings of Curv:
* A 3 pane GUI where the language is Python.
* Javascript integration, running in a web browser.
* Jupyter integration.
* ipython integration.
* a Curv GUI or UI architected in the correct way. Rich text with embeddable
  GUI components. Some kind of FRP. GUI components can be optionally implemented
  using the Curv geometry engine. Maybe some embedding of FRP in Curv, eg to
  support audio reactive models, etc.
* Stuff that Gilad Bracha has said.
  * Live literate programming (eg, for Curv documentation and tutorials).
    "Ideally we'd want an interactive editor that smoothly integrated writing
    and all manner of interactive content."
