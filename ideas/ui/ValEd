Structure Editing via Value Editors
===================================
Manipulating output values to specify programs

* glisp (graphical lisp)
* TSE (Tiny Structure Editors)

"Emerging value-centric IDEs, such as those that provide programming by
examples (PBE) or bidirectional transformation (BX) modalities, in which
users manipulate output values to specify programs"

Instances of user-defined ADTs can be presented using a high level, domain
specific syntax, and this syntax is editable, using a GUI, to modify the value.
applications:
  Literals in a Structure Editor:
  Programming by Examples (PBE):
    Given input-output examples, these systems synthesize a small program.
  Direct Manipulation Programming:
    Several tools augment text-based coding with direct manipulation of
    output values.
    * Bidirectional Programming (BX): Edit constructor expressions in the output
      of a program to thereby change appropriate literals in the original code.
    * Output-directed programming (ODP): allow the user to make larger,
      structural changes to the program, refactoring or inserting new code.
