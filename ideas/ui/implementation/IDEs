IDE frameworks that I could try to integrate Curv into.

https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/ -- Apache 2, Java. Highly regarded by devs.
But 3D graphics in Java? Nobody writes games in Java. So I'd have to futz
with half-working OpenGL bindings or something.

Glamorous Toolkit -- custom distro of Pharo Smalltalk using Skia
for graphics. I would have to fork it and integrate a GPU API (WebGPU)
into Smalltalk, integrated with Skia so that WebGPU and Skia APIs can render
into the same context.

Jupyter -- GUI runs in a web browser.
