Lager: C++17 UI Framework based on immutable values & pure functions.
https://sinusoid.es/lager/introduction.html

Lager is a C++ library to assist value-oriented design by implementing the
unidirectional data-flow architecture. It is heavily inspired by Elm and
Redux, and enables composable designs by promoting the use of simple value
types and testable application logic via pure functions.

Both data and the call graph are acyclic.
Immutable values + acyclic data means you can take snapshots and time travel
debugging, undo are easy to implement.
