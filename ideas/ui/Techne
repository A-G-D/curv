Techne is a radical new platform and user interface wherein:
 * The UI combines graphics and direct manipulation (from GUIs)
   with programmability, abstraction mechanisms and composability (from CLIs).
 * Whenever you edit something, change its state, using the user interface,
   you are always _editing source code_.
 * T-Code is the universal representation for all code and data in this system.
   It is a hierarchical data structure that supports abstraction mechanisms.
   Like S-Expressions, it is simple and hierarchical.
   It is higher level than byte sequences.
 * Source code is made of out T-Code. Data is made out of T-Code.
   Maybe Data is T-Code in head-normal form.
