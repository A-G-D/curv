GLSL doesn't support recursive functions, but I could allow tail recursion
and compile it into a loop.

For performance reasons, I may want to support vectorized code that can
be compiled into SIMD instructions. A researchy idea is to provide array
language constructs, and compile those into efficient vectorized code.
