Code that fits your brain -- Adam Tornhill

Beauty is the absence of ugliness. We are designed to find beauty attractive,
and this transfers to technology, UIs and code.

Beautiful code lacks ugliness. Ugliness in code is everything that puts an
unnecessary load on our brain. Complexity, inconsistency.

Working memory. Vital for reasoning about code. A limited resource: 3-7 items.
How to increase it: chunking. Each chunk is a pattern of smaller items.
Chunks are hierarchical.
    Memory is hierarchical. Memory works by categorizing things, creating
    hierarchical classifications.
        To make programs easy to understand, we need to leverage this.
