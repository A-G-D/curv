Jack Rusher, 1 July 2020, Future of Coding:
    There are two important modes at work in invention/innovation, both of
    which require considerable creativity.

    The first, which typically happens in places shielded from commerce
    (e.g. universities, personal projects, rare industrial labs like Bell
    and Xerox), is a kind of mad-eyed push into the unknown that produces
    novelties.

    The second is a process whereby people with good taste curate and refine
    those novelties, ultimately turning them into products.

    I think of these two activities as a cultural analogy to seeding and
    harvesting. We need support for both of these modes to get the good
    stuff into general use.

    When looked at from this perspective, Apple was one of the best harvesters
    we've ever seen in consumer technology.

    (Aside: there's been an ideological shift since the 80s that attributes
    all value creation to harvesting, which in turn has led to a tremendous
    reduction in funding for seeders. This is my guess as to why we're still
    using 40 year old technology today.)
