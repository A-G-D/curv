Voxel File Formats
==================
Curv will support the import and export of voxel files.
Which file formats?
* Formats supported by other tools.
* With good compression?
* With metadata for mapping raw voxels onto a Curv shape?
* Do I need to invent a new format to satisfy these requirements?

Types of voxel data I may need to represent:
* signed distance field. 32 bit floats.
* intensity field, values between 0 and 1. Nats with 1,2,4,8,16,32 bits.
* colour field: RGB
* colour field: RGBA

Standard file formats may not have the metadata Curv needs to map voxels
onto the global coordinate system:
  { voxel_size:[vx,vy,vz], origin:[ox,oy,oz] }
So put standard file data + metadata into a container file format,
or use two sibling files in a directory. Or three files: metadata, SDF, RGB.
* RSDF -- regularly sampled distance field
* RSIF -- regularly sampled intensity field

Beyond this simple metadata, I may need to support hierarchical data
structures that are more efficient to load and process, rather than
a flat rectangular array of voxels. Maybe it's too expensive to create
the data structure when loading voxels into a viewer. Eg,
* VDB
* Sparse Voxel Octree

* Mipmap
* BVH

KTX is the Khronos TeXture format: a universal container format
for "supercompressed GPU textures". KTX 2.0 supports most of the Vulkan 1.2
vkFormat texture formats, including VK_FORMAT_R32_SFLOAT (1 32bit float
per voxel).

GLTX is a Khronos container file format for 3D assets.
Eg, KTX data + metadata. Maybe it can support Curv metadata?

--------------
FFV1 is a lossless video format supported by FFmpeg.
Excellent compression, very fast decode/encode, open source.
Test this to see if is usable for voxel grids, and if the compression ratio
is better than the alternatives.

The new AV1 standard is open source, royalty free, supported by all the big
tech companies, and aims to dominate all previous video formats.
It supports lossless encoding, although not as a primary goal.
Try it and see, compare to FFV1.

SVX is a voxel array format that Shapeways attempted to popularize.
As of 2018, it is moribund. No one really supports it. Shapeways still
supports it for their service, but they don't mention the format on their
web site anymore. It uses an array of PNG files inside a ZIP container.
That's easy, but measure the compression ratio against the alternatives.

VDB.

The 3MF committee was investigating voxel formats in 2018.
Nothing seems to have come of that (2021).

Shapeways just announced Stratasys J750 support! (Launch in 2019.)
Voxel files are needed to fully exploit the hardware.
