Voxel File Formats
==================
Curv will support the import and export of voxel files.
Which file formats?
* Formats supported by other tools.
* If necessary, invent a new format that is more practical than existing
  alternatives. Eg, because it has really good compression.

Types of voxel data I may need to represent:
* signed distance field. 32 bit floats.
* intensity field, values between 0 and 1.
* colour field: RGB
* colour field: RGBA

FFV1 is a lossless video format supported by FFmpeg.
Excellent compression, very fast decode/encode, open source.
Test this to see if is usable for voxel grids, and if the compression ratio
is better than the alternatives.

The new AV1 standard is open source, royalty free, supported by all the big
tech companies, and aims to dominate all previous video formats.
It supports lossless encoding, although not as a primary goal.
Try it and see, compare to FFV1.

SVX is a voxel array format that Shapeways attempted to popularize.
As of 2018, it is moribund. No one really supports it. Shapeways still
supports it for their service, but they don't mention the format on their
web site anymore. It uses an array of PNG files inside a ZIP container.
That's easy, but measure the compression ratio against the alternatives.

The 3MF committee is investigating voxel formats.

Shapeways just announced Stratasys J750 support! (Launch in 2019.)
Voxel files are needed to fully exploit the hardware.
