Conventional 2D primitives (the Postscript model that everyone uses)
can be rendered much faster on a modern GPU, than is done by current software.
So this the best platform for building a 2D GUI toolkit -- the speed can
open new possibilities.

The Curv 2D subsystem should adapt these ideas.

These projects are largely focused on fast rasterization, whereas Curv needs
a signed distance field to feed into further shape operators. But I think I
can extract useful approaches from this work.

Glyphy: high quality font rendering using SDFs on the GPU.
Not as high performance as the previous projects, but looks plenty fast enough
in the demo part of the talk (https://vimeo.com/83732058), plus he is showing
an SDF of a page of text and performing all sorts of transformations on the SDF
at 60 FPS.
