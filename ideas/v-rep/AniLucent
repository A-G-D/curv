Animation and Translucency
--------------------------
Two planned changes to the representation of shapes, colour fields,
and intensity fields.

To support lazy rendering, we need to tag shapes, colour fields, and intensity
fields with a boolean `animated` field. If false, then time is assumed to be 0.

To support the Stratasys J750 (supported by Shapeways in 2019),
we need to support translucent shapes. Colour values now have an alpha
component.

Translucent shapes are more expensive to render, so shapes and colour fields
need a boolean `translucent` field. If false, then alpha is assumed to be 1.

A colour field is a record containing:
    colour : [x,y,z,t] -> [r,g,b,a]
    animated : boolean
    translucent : boolean

An intensity field is a record containing:
    intensity : [x,y,z,t] -> n
    animated : boolean

Colour_Field and Intensity_Field records are graphical values.
Note that Colour_Field :> Shape.

Note that a shape may be animated due to its distance field, its colour field,
or both. When we upcast a Shape to a Colour_Field, the animated field might be
a false positive. This could be handled by storing two animated fields, one in
the colour function itself.

Colour API
----------
sRGB(r,g,b) -> colour
    This will change so that the result is (lr,lg,lb,a).

sRGB(r,g,b,a) -> colour
    New API.

The GL compiler will now need to deal with the overloaded sRGB function.

Colour Field API
----------------
Current API:
  colour c shape
    c matches Vec3, (ifield,cmap), shape, fun
  texture = colour
  make_texture c

New API:
  colour c shape
    c matches Vec3, Vec4, (ifield,cmap), cfield, fun
  make_colour c

Intensity Field API
-------------------
Current API:
  i_radial, i_concentric, i_gyroid, i_animate
  show_ifield

New API:
  make_ifield if
    if matches number, fun, ifield
