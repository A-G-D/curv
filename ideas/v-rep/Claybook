Claybook is a game that simulates clay using SDFs. No triangles.
Physics & fluid simulation on GPU. No baked lighting or shadows, all real time.

F-Rep based SDFs can be really slow (as distance function gets complex).
Solve problem using discrete SDFs using volume textures.
Volume textures can be huge, but are sampled sparsely, which kills the GPU
texture cache, so use mip maps to sample areas not close to a surface.
