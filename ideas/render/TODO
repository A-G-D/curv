Ambient Occlusion:
* http://theorangeduck.com/page/neural-network-ambient-occlusion
  Screen space ambient occlusion, 1.5ms, using stored per-pixel depth & normal.

`render <render-record> <shape>` -- adds pickers for render params
* depends on Abstract Value proposal

Redesigned Rendering Parameters:
* camera
* shading (towards a universal, parameterized shading model)
  * sf1: apply lighting on ray hit
  * background colour: solid colour, or pattern (2D & 3D cases)
  * shadows: none, ambient or traced. Can traced be made orthogonal to sf1?
    Perhaps ambient occlusion is an independent term.
  * light sources.
    * Point sources. How to optimize lighting code: 1 source or multiple,
      white light or coloured?
    * Ambient. This should just be a single value.
  * open source, F-Rep/SDF, universal shading model, preferably PBM:
    * mTec (PBM, 1 light source, GL4.3)
    * FragM?,
    * Blender Eevee "Principled BSDF", aka PBM, compatible with Renderman,
      Unreal Engine, etc. Real-time rendering. OpenGL 3.3.
