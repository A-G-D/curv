Plain Old Data
==============

  "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure
  than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures."
  -- Alan Perlis, "Epigrams on Programming" (1982)

Curv provides a small number of "universal data types" that are used
to represent most data. This feature is called Plain Old Data (POD).

POD makes Curv very simple and composable, when compared to mainstream
programming languages.
* Composability: Inspired by Lisp S-Expressions, XML, JSON, and similar systems.
  These data representations are popular precisely because they allow
  easy interoperability between software components. In Curv, the pervasive
  use of POD makes everything more composable.
* Simplicity: There is only 1 kind of number, one kind of list (aka an ordered
  sequence), and one kind of record, instead of multiple domain-specific
  versions of each data type, and forcing you to choose between similar
  alternatives.
