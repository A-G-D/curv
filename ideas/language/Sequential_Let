Sequential Let
==============
This is a redesign of how sequential (mutable) variables are defined and used.
This language change can be introduced by adding new syntax and deprecating
old syntax, without breaking backward compatibility.

New Syntax
----------
 1. `let a := 0; b := 1; in ...` is a "sequential let". It defines sequential
    variables that can be assigned or referenced in the body.
    * Between let and in, we use sequential scoping, and the definitions are
      executed in order.
    * There is no support for abbreviated function definitions
      such as 'f x := x + 1' because that syntax might be confused with
      'a[i] := x' array element update? Debateable. Sequential scoping makes
      function definitions less useful (no recursion).
    * The body is a sequential phrase: a statement or a do phrase. If the body
      is a do phrase, and if the body of the do is also sequential, then the
      scope of the sequential variables is extended to the do body.
 2. The body of a while is now a statement (previously, an action).
 3. If a 'do' phrase is used as a statement in a list (or record) constructor,
    the statements between 'do' and 'in' may be element (or field) generators.

Eg,
* let i := 0; t:=0; in do while (i < n) (t := t + i; i := i + 1); in t
* let i := 0; in ( while (i < n) (print i; i:=i+1;); )
* [ let i := 0; in while (i < n) (i; i:=i+1;); ]
* { let i := 0; in while (i < n) ("$i":i; i:=i+1;); }

Benefits:
* `let` is consistently used to define all varieties of local variables.
* `while` is now available in list and record comprehensions.
* Generalized blocks work in all statement contexts.

Alt syntax:
    let_mutable
        a := 0;
        b := a + 1;
    in
        ...
Benefits:
* The name `let_mutable` becomes the name for this feature.
  It makes the feature easy to talk about, and easy to google, and it's easy
  to know when the feature is being used.
* The name is more descriptive. Gives more clues to the reader.
* An IDE can perhaps provide better assistance after you type either `let`
  or `let_mutable`.
* If `let` is overloaded, then it is complicated to describe the syntax of
  a let clause. There is potential for confusion about the scope rules for
  variables defined by a `let`, since the scoping could be either sequential
  or recursive. You might expect to be able to use both = and := in the same
  scope, just based on the syntax.

Generalized Blocks
------------------
In an imperative language, a block is a mixed sequence of local variable
definitions and statements. In Curv, statements and definitions are segregated,
but we can still have alternating statements and definitions, like this:
    do
        statements;
    in let
        definitions;
    in do
        statements;
    in
        result
We want this syntax to work in list and record constructors.
If `do` is used in a list constructor, then the 'statements' may include
both actions and value generators. Likewise, if `do` is used in a record
constructor, the statements may be actions or field generators.

Other Thoughts
--------------
A previously considered extension. Allow list and record constructors
to be sequential phrases. This now seems less important.
* let i := 0; in [ while (i < n) (i; i:=i+1;); ]
* let i := 0; in { while (i < n) ("$i":i; i:=i+1;); }

Deprecated Syntax
-----------------
* The `var` keyword.
* `var` variable definitions in a `do` clause.
  The `do` clause contains actions, but not definitions.
* `var` variable definitions in a record constructor.
* Actions in a `let` clause. (They'd be ambiguous anyway, due to `a:=b`.)
  The `let` clause now just contains definitions.
  No need to put "asserts" into a `let` clause; just chain a `do` clause.
* Actions in a `where` clause. (This is more debatable.)

Brainstorming Notes
===================
The body of a while loop must be an action.
It can't be used in a list or record comprehension.
I want to fix this.

To use while, you need one or more sequential variables.
There is also a problem using these in a list or record comprehension.

List comprehension problem:
    ERROR: not an operation
    1| [var x:=1; x:=2; x]
        ^^^^^^^^          

Record comprehension problems:
    curv> {var x:=1; x:=2;}
    {x:2}
    This is a problem because you don't want iteration variables belonging
    to a while loop to be added to your record.

    ERROR: not an action
    1| {var i:=0; while(i<3) ("$i":0; i:=i+1;)}
                              ^^^^^^           

    I am thinking about allowing recursive definitions and field generators
    to co-exist in a record constructor. If you also allow sequential
    definitions in the same scope as these other phrases, what does that mean?

Original Proposal
-----------------
 1. The `while` action is generalized so that the body can contain generators
    or binders, same as how the `for` operation is already generalized.

 2. If the body of a `do` is a record or list constructor, then the `do`'s
    sequential scope is continued into the body of the constructor.
    Reassignments and `while` phrases may be used in the constructor body.

    `do <sequential definitions> in [ <generators, actions, reassignments> ]`
    `do <sequential definitions> in { <binders, actions, reassignments> }`

    This syntax segregates the definitions (which are outside the constructor)
    from the generators/binders (which are inside the constructor).
    It avoids the ambiguity of putting local definitions (which don't define
    a field) inside a record constructor.

`while (c) (a;b;c)` is an iterative compound phrase.

`do var i:= 0 in [while (i < 10) (i; i:=i+1)]`

Thoughts on Records
-------------------
To support while in a record constructor, the iteration variables must not
be defined in the record scope. Either they are defined outside the record,
as in the above proposal, or there is some kind of block syntax wherein you
embed a block in a record literal, and the block locally defines iteration
variables and also contains the while.

Also, "sequential record literals" are unnecessary and can be removed from the
language.

Rethinking Blocks
-----------------
`do <sequential definitions and actions> in <phrase>`.
The first argument of `do` feels like an Algol68 block, as you have have
definitions and actions intermixed. However, when you use compound statements
in this 'block', the arguments of the compound statements can be compound
actions, but they cannot be 'blocks'. This feels inconsistent, when
transliterating code from a block language like GLSL.

Alternatives:
 1. Be consistent by always separating sequential definitions from the
    statements that reference them, similar to "Original Proposal".
 2. Be consistent by introducing a block syntax that lets you mix locally
    scoped sequential definitions with statements. A block is a statement.
    This is consistent with popular imperative languages.
    However, the contents of a record constructor are not a block,
    even though they may contain a statement sequence.

Design #1: Sequential Let
-------------------------
The `let` and `where` clause contains definitions, but not actions.
Don't need to put "asserts" into a `let` clause; just chain a `do` clause.
The `do` clause contains actions, but not definitions.

The `var` keyword is dropped. "Sequential record constructors" are dropped.

`let a := 0; b := 1; in ...` is a "sequential let". It defines sequential
variables that can be assigned or referenced in the body. The body can
assign variables if it is a sequential phrase: statement, do phrase,
record constructor, list constructor.
Eg,
* let i := 0; t:=0; in do while (i < n) (t := t + i; i := i + 1); in t
* let i := 0; in [ while (i < n) (i; i:=i+1;); ]
* let i := 0; in { while (i < n) ("$i":i; i:=i+1;); }
* let i := 0; in ( while (i < n) (print i; i:=i+1;); )

Existing forms of definition abstraction: semicolon and paren phrase.
Do we need this much syntactic flexibility?

The only context where actions and definitions can potentially still mix
is a record constructor. Pure use cases:
* Just recursive definitions, no mixing.
* Just assignments, actions, field constructors. No mixing.
Mixed use cases:
* Recursive definitions plus actions (eg, assert).
* Recursive definitions plus field constructors (proposed extension).

'action' is not a subtype of 'definition'. Record literals are a special case.

Benefits:
* More restricted grammar should be easier to learn and explain.
* `let` is consistently used for introducing local variables.
  In imperative code, `let a=...` is used for defining const variables,
  and `let a:=...` is used for defining mutable variables.

Drawbacks:
* Rigid separation of definitions from statements/assignments is less
  convenient when translating code from a block-structured imperative language.

Design #2: Statement Blocks
---------------------------
A compound statement may contain sequential variable definitions,
using the `var name := initial_value' syntax. This binds a name local to the
statement block, with sequential scope.

As with #1,
* The syntax of a `do` becomes `do <action> in <phrase>`.
* "Sequential record constructors" are dropped.

Eg,
* do var i := 0; var t:=0; while (i < n) (t := t + i; i := i + 1); in t
* [ var i := 0; while (i < n) (i; i:=i+1;); ]
* { var i := 0; while (i < n) ("$i":i; i:=i+1;); }
* ( var i := 0; while (i < n) (print i; i:=i+1;); )

Benefit: More compatible with the syntax of GLSL and other block structured
imperative languages. Easier to transliterate code, since you don't need
to use `let` and introduce nesting to define a variable in the middle of
a compound statement.

Drawbacks: Two quite different syntaxes for defining local variables.
Suppose I'm transliterating GLSL code, and there is a variable defined in
the middle of a compound statement.
    ...;
    const float a = expr;
    ...;
becomes
    ...;
    let a = expr;
    in ...;
but
    ...;
    float a = expr;
    ...;
becomes
    ...;
    var a := expr;
    ...;
(Unless I introduce `const name = expr` as an imperative-style alternative
to `let`.)

Within a mixed record constructor, `a=...` is a recursive definition that
creates a field, while `var a:=...` is a sequential definition that defines
a local variable, but does not create field. This is confusing, when compared
to #1, which uses `let` to introduce local variables.
