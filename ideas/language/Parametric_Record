A parametric record remembers how it was constructed.
It remembers its construction parameters, and it allows you to selectively
change those parameters and make a modified copy of the record.

This is a bit like prototype-based programming, in the sense that you can have
a set of prototypical objects, and you construct new instances of these objects
by cloning the prototypes, with alterations (rather than by calling constructor
functions). That's where the similarity ends. There is no inheritance or
delegation.

Use cases:
* As a mechanism for hooking graphical value pickers into a shape.
* Can view a shape using 'curv foo.curv', then modify parameters
  on the command line using -D options.
* Similar to OpenSCAD2 customizable objects, supports a simple form of
  prototype-based programming in Curv.

Suppose R is a parametric record. Then R contains two special fields:
* `R.parameter` is a record containing the construction parameters.
* `R.call` is a function that maps a record of construction parameters
  (all of which are optional) onto a new instance of R.
  So `R.call(R.parameter)` returns R.
  Since the parameters are all optional, `R{}` also returns R.

Basic Syntax
------------
For example, a parametric shape in file `lollipop.curv`:
  parameters
    diam = 1;
    len = 4;
  in
    union(candy, stick)
  where (
    candy = sphere diam >> colour red;
    stick = cylinder {h: len, d: diam/8} >> move(0,0,-len/2);
  )
This returns a record (union(candy,stick)) augmented with a `call` field,
which is a function with parameter {diam=1,len=4} that returns a customized
version of the record, and a `parameter` field (containing {diam=1,len=4}).

The command
  curv -Dlen=6 lollipop.curv
modifies one of the shape parameters. Actually it treats the result
value V as a function, and calls V{len:6}.

Parameter Syntax
----------------
The parameter list is actually a list of field patterns with mandatory default
values. In the semantics, this parameter list must be convertable to either a
record pattern or to a record literal. It's not quite the same as a definition
list following `let` or `where`. Although I'd like the common cases to be
written in the same way.

* There are no dependencies between parameters. One parameter can't reference
  another.
* Function definition syntax is not legal, although you can use a lambda
  expression as a default value. The semantic reason for this is that the
  parameters don't form a scope. A recursive definition wouldn't work, nor
  would references to other parameters in the function body.
  (Syntactically, f x = a is a field pattern containing a predicate pattern,
  it can't be parsed as a function definition.)
* `(x,y,z) = default` is not legal, even though that is a legal definition,
  because there is no parameter name.
* This is supported: `fieldname: varname = default`? It might be useful
  for using a verbose name with embedded spaces in the value picker UI,
  while using a short identifier in the code body.
* This is supported: `fieldname: (x,y,z) = default`.
* Field patterns may be separated by commas (unlike let or where).
* Can we support dependencies between parameters? No.
  Suppose we allow R = parametric{x=1,y=x+1}f(x,y). This creates the expectation
  that R{x=2} will implicitly set y to 3. In actual fact, the default values
  for parameters are independent of each other, and are stored as a simple
  record value in the parametric record, as the `parameter` field. Making
  a customized instance of a parametric records changes these default values.
  There is no reasonable implementation for parameter dependencies.

Ideas for partially unifying let definitions with parametric parameter specs:
* Scopeless let. Use letrec for a recursive scope.
* Function definitions are prefixed with `func`.
  `x y = z` has a predicate pattern on left, in both cases.
* `func f x = y` is a field pattern that matches a function valued field `f`
  and provides a default value.
* `(x,y,z) = expr` is a field pattern that matches 3 separate fields, and
  their defaults are obtained by decomposing `expr`.

Alternate Syntax
----------------
The original proposal uses `parameters ... in ...`, very much like `let`.
But the actual parameter syntax differs, see above. So that could lead to
confusion, if you expect that you can just replace `let` with `parameters`
and have things still work.

So instead, use
    parametric {...} record_expr
which reflects that fact that the parameters are field patterns with defaults.
This is closely related to:
    {...} -> record_expr

parametric {
  slider(.5,4) diam = 1;
  slider(2,8)  len = 4;
}
  union(candy, stick)
where (
  candy = sphere diam >> colour red;
  stick = cylinder {h: len, d: diam/8} >> move(0,0,-len/2);
)

kube = parametric{d=2} cube d;

kube =
  match [
    d -> cube d;
    parametric {d=2} cube d;
  ];

One criticism, for top level bindings, is that let, where and parametric
use 3 different syntaxes for delimiting their bindings.

Semantics
---------
    kube =
      parameters
        d = 2;
      in
        box(d,d,d);
or
    parametric kube{d:2} = box(d,d,d);

is just syntactic sugar for:

kube =
    make{d:2}
where (
    make{d} =
      { ... box(d,d,d);
        call{d=d} : make{d:d};
        parameter : {d:d};
      };
);

Prototype Libraries
-------------------
Can we change the existing primitive shape constructors (like cube) to
parametric records? One advantage is customization in the Viewer. Another is
that the code might shrink if we use the `parametric` operator.

But, there's a backward compatibility and expressiveness issue:
1. `cube` just takes a number argument.
2. Half-plane is overloaded with several record patterns.
3. The sharp solids have `.exact` and `.mitred` variants.

Can we preserve these interfaces in the shape constructors?

1. "Just a number argument." We could extend `parametric` to allow a
   non-record parameter, as in `parametric (is_num n) -> box(n,n,n)`.
   Now `.parameter` is a num instead of a record. The Viewer can still
   provide a value picker.

   Alternately, `cube` is overloaded over `cube n` and `cube{d:n}`. The former
   syntax is forwarded to the latter; the latter yields a parametric shape.
   So, we don't need to extend `parametric` to allow a non-record parameter.

2. Overloading.
   * There is no prototypical half-plane. There's no problem writing a
     half_plane constructor as a `match` of a list of prototypes.
     Then half_plane will return a prototype, but that prototype is not
     itself overloaded on multiple record patterns. But that's good enough
     for displaying value pickers.
   * An overloaded prototype is more difficult.
     Maybe `match`, given a list of prototypes, returns a prototype.
     Then how does the Viewer create a UI for this?

3. ".exact" and ".mitred" variants, like for "cube".
   If only the original "cube" has the variants, and not the clones,
   then the code is simple. If we want the Viewer to provide pickers for
   choosing between exact and mitred, then more difficult.

Named Parametric Records
------------------------
In addition to the required `call` and `parameter` fields,
let's add an optional `name` field.
* This is used as a title for the picker window.
* If the name is present, then a parametric record is printed as `name{params}`.
  Eg, "cube{d:2}" is a lot more readable than dumping the cube record.
* `parametric cube{is_distance d} = box(d,d,d)`. Now `cube` constructs a named
  parametric record.
* Now we need a way to print values verbosely.

Functions have an optional name, too, which are also used for printing.
For consistency, maybe f.name is defined if function value f has a name.

See `Terms`_ for more details.
