Clojure.Spec
============
This is a mechanism to specify the structure of data, for data validation,
destructuring of compound data, and generative testing.

Spec is more expressive than a static type system, because it isn't limited
to describing things that can be proved by a static type checker. Specs can
be constructed by composing predicate functions.

Writing a spec enables automatic:
  * Validation
  * Error reporting
  * Destructuring
  * Instrumentation
  * Test-data generation
  * Generative test generation
