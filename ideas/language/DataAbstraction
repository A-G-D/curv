Data Abstraction and Generic Programming
========================================

Data Abstraction means several things to me:
* The act of coding a generic algorithm, which involves specifying the
  minimum requirements on the data that the algorithm acts on.
  I would like to support generic programming in Curv, as long as it doesn't
  involve too much language complexity. Ideally, generic programming arises
  as a side effect of simplicity, orthogonality and generality, rather than
  being supported by complex, specialized features.
* The complex facilities found in general purpose languages for defining
  data types, which may include classes, inheritance, information hiding,
  types, user defined types, type constructors, and so on. These features
  in C++, Haskell, CLOS, etc, are far too complex for Curv.

The original Curv design rejects complex features for defining data types.
There are only 7 types: the 6 JSON data types, plus functions. There are no
user defined types, and no concept of a named type. You represent data
structures the same way you do when encoding them in JSON.

I'm not 100% happy with this. In some cases, like shapes, the representation can
be large and messy, and I don't always want to dump this representation on the
screen when you examine the value. Now I'm thinking about parametric shapes,
which know what their parameters are, and let you interactively modify those
parameters using a GUI. Now I want to separate the outside representation of
a shape from its inside representation (both can be examined). The outside
representation is a constructor name, and a set of parameters.

So there is plain and fancy data.
* Plain data is JSON data, and you construct it directly using using JSON
  value constructors. When you print the data, it looks like JSON.
  Pattern matching works using JSON value constructors.
* Fancy data is constructed using high level constructor functions.
  The underlying representation is usually a record.
  When you print the data, it looks like calls to high level constructor
  functions. Pattern matching uses calls to constructor functions.
  So this is a kind of data abstraction.

[Functions are maybe another kind of value where you have an outside and
an inside representation. In some languages that are based on Symbolic
Expressions, a function is represented internally by a data structure that
you can examine. I can see some utility in doing this for Curv: it provides
a low level mechanism that would allow more language primitives to be coded
in Curv rather than in C++. But this is tangential to the main concerns of
this page.]

Fancy Data
----------
* Fancy data is constructed using high level constructor functions.
* The printed representation looks like calls to constructor functions.
* Pattern matching uses calls to constructor functions.

Fancy data is important for visual programming. A parametric shape is a fancy
datum with constructor arguments that you can tweak in the Viewer window
using graphical value pickers. Fancy data may be nodes in a node-based
visual programming environment.

Fancy data can support a particular style of generic programming, where
CLOS-like generic functions have different implementations for different
constructors. Closely related to Haskell type classes, with dynamic dispatch.

Fancy data will use the simplest design that works. This design is being
driven by the requirements of visual programming. There is no intent to mimic
the data abstraction mechanisms of general purpose programming languages.
Instead, I'm trying to let the requirements determine the design.

Maximally Generic Functions
---------------------------
I'll start by describing a system that maximizes the reuseability and
generality of generic functions.

A Signature is:
* A set of abstract type names.
* A set of value and function names, together with requirements that
  give the semantics of these value names.
  A requirement for a value name could be a type signature, written in
  some static type language. For a simple example, value V has type T,
  where T is one of the abstract type names.
  Requirements can more generally be axioms: equations
  that must be true, involving one or more named values.
  Since axioms can describe relationships between two or more named values,
  they can describe requirements that can't be described using just a type
  signature.

Signatures can be organized into a multiple inheritance DAG.
Examples from abstract algebra: Group and Monoid are signatures;
Group is a subsignature of Monoid.

A Structure is an instance or a concrete implementation of a Signature.

Note that Structures are not contained inside of types, so this is not like
OOP. You could have multiple structures, defined in different modules or
packages by different authors, that implement different signatures for the
same concrete type. For example, you could have two different structures
that implement the Monoid signature for Number: one would be the additive
monoid, the other the multiplicative monoid.

An interface in OOP is like a restricted Signature over exactly one type.
And a class in OOP is like a Structure that implements an interface.

A generic algorithm is an algorithm that uses named types and values and
functions described by a signature. A generic algorithm can be instantiated
for any structure that implements that signature. When a structure contains
one or more functions that are defined in terms of the structure's signature,
those functions are generic algorithms.

My model for this system is the SML module system.
C++ templates are another system with this goal.
A related system is Racket's combination of Units and Mixins:
http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/icfp98-ff/icfp98-ff.pdf

What these systems have in common is that, in order for a generic
algorithm to be maximally generic, it must be embedded in some kind of
parameterized module. Eg, the parameters can have signature types and the
arguments can be structures. Maybe all of the parameters have default values,
but to cover all the use cases, you have to be able to explicitly invoke
the module multiple times with different arguments.

Curv can mostly do this already. You can define a generic function inside
a parameterized record, and invoke the parameterized record with structure
arguments. You could even use a parametric record, so that passing an
argument is completely optional.

There is missing syntactic sugar: if the structure defines a '+' operator,
you can't invoke it from inside the generic function using a+b syntax.
* What would that look like? Maybe, following Mathematica, a+b is a hardwired
  synonym for plus[a,b].
    S.plus(a, b)
    a S.+ b

In Mathematica, code and data are represented by symbolic expressions,
which can be manipulated as data. I think you can also reinterpret the meaning
of unbound symbols within an S-expression. In which case, there is no need
to plan ahead and explicitly parameterize a generic function with respect to
its dependencies?
* If this account is true, then it is in conflict with the idea of a closure,
  where a function value carries around bindings for all of its dependencies.
* Curv could have operations for querying and modifying the environment of a
  closure. Is this a good idea? It seems related to the idea of a parametric
  record, which also has an 'environment' that you can query and modify.
* I suspect that genericity may be more complex than this. Perhaps, in some
  cases, it is necessary to decide which occurrences of '+' belong to which
  signatures. Either your type system deduces this for you (as in Haskell with
  type classes) or you do it manually.

Dynamic Type Tags
-----------------
Curv is dynamically typed. Curv values contain type tags that attest to
their type. A type is not the same thing as a signature or a structure,
so this is different from OOP, where a class is a type. Signatures contain
abstract type names, and values contain type tags: am I using the word "type"
consistently in these two cases? Maybe a Signature is a Pattern.

What are the possible type tags?
* List values contain an element type. This is for efficiency reasons.
  A general list [a,b,c] can contain any type of value.
  A string "abc" is a list restricted to only contain character values.
  Once I support image import, I will have image data values, which are
  arrays of pixel values, using a compact type-specific representation
  for the pixel values (ie, not 64 bit boxed values). And I will have types
  that correspond to various pixel value representations.
  In-place update of a list will be restricted to members of the list's
  element type.
* Atomic types (null, bool, character, number) have a type tag.
  Looks like there will be multiple numeric types, due to image import.
* There are an infinite number of record type tags.
  There's some way to construct a branded record, I think.
  Maybe related to the 'term' proposal.
  Record branding means we are diverging from duck typing.
  But, it allows overloading an interface,
* Function values can also be branded. A brand on a function attests to that
  function having certain properties, so we are diverging from duck typing.

Is there a concept of "subtype" for type tags?
I think so. An imported 8 bit greyscale image has pixel values in the range 0
to 1, but represented as 8 bits, not as 64 bits. So that's a subtype of Number.
(Julia doesn't have subtype relationships between concrete types.
On the other hand, Julia has abstract types, which I don't think makes sense
in my framework. I have signatures and structures instead.)
