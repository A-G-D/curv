Curv has a complex syntax. For somebody not familiar with this kind of language,
making mistakes, understanding and fixing syntax errors could involve a steep
learning curve. This seems to be the case for Elm, and Curv is not far from Elm.

How can we mitigate this problem?
* Can the syntax be made more beginner friendly?
  There are languages designed for teaching, eg the Pyret language.
* Can syntax error messages be more helpful? That's what Elm has done.
* Provide an integrated programmer's assistant editor that makes it easier
  to write code without syntax errors. For Lisp, we have ParEdit and ParInfer.
  For an Elm-like syntax, investigate Hazel.
  * Perhaps layout is fully automatic. Certain syntax errors will result in
    unexpected layout, prompting you to fix the problem.
