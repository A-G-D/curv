Minimal Syntax
==============
Support Visual Curv. There is a projectional editor that can present code
in either of two formats:
* A pure text format supporting copy, paste and easy sharing across internet.
* A "visual" syntax, perhaps inspired by the node-and-wire languages that are
  popular with artists for graphics processing (eg, Magic, Nuke, Blender).

Traditionally, text syntax and node-and-wire syntax both require the user to
manually perform layout. For text syntax, manual layout includes deciding
where to add line breaks and how much to indent each line. For node-and-wire,
manual layout includes specifying the X,Y position of each node in a 2D canvas.

I want the editor to perform automated layout in both cases.
The user doesn't manually lay out each node in a program tree, and layout
metadata isn't stored. (If it were stored, it would have to be separately
specified for each presentation mode, which is terrible.)
By choosing automatic layout, and not storing detailed layout instructions
in the source code, we are free to experiment with new visual syntaxes.

Eliminating Syntactic Variability
---------------------------------
It makes sense to more generally eliminate syntactic variability, so that
you are not maintaining syntactic distinctions in the text presentation
that are not relevant in the graphical (node-and-wire) display.

There is a formatting tool that converts Curv text syntax to canonical form,
like gofmt and others. What kinds of syntactic variability are erased by the
formatting tool? What are the implications for Curv syntax?

 1. No layout. Indentation & line breaks are not preserved.
 2. Yes parens. `(a + b) + c` is distinct from `a + (b + c)`.
    Parens are preserved, so that we can display Curv using traditional
    math notation. (And this ability is prioritized over the ability to
    display Lisp notation.)

brainstorming:
 3. (a,b) vs [a,b]. These are the same in Curv. That's a pretty rare language
    feature. These syntaxes ought to be collapsed to [a,b]. This is at the
    expense of "breaking" standard math notation, no `f(x,y)` function calls.
    Use f[x,y] instead.
 4. [a,b] vs [a;b]. These are the same in Curv. 'a' and 'b' are interpreted
    as statements in both cases. Logically I should pick [a;b], for consistency
    with (a;b) compound statements. That leads to f[x;y] function calls.
 5. multi-branch 'if-then-elsif-then-else' vs tail-nested
    'if-then-else if-then-else'. Curv uses the latter, it simplifies the
    definition of 'if-then-else', and tail nesting is a nice form of composition
    that works in a lot of situations. But, you lose the ability to choose
    whether a trailing if-then-else ought to be indented, or is a continuation
    of a multi-branch decision. Since we have no layout. This seems to be an
    argument for a multi-branch if. Oh, actually, the solution is to add
    parens around the trailing if. Problem solved.

Optional Parentheses
--------------------
In most text-based languages, users choose whether or not to add parentheses
to disambiguate infix expressions in languages with many precedence levels.
In Lisp, there is no such choice to be made.

Eliminating this choice from the syntax might make Curv more portable
between visual presentations.

The ParInfer text editor interface provides a nice UI for editing S-expressions.
Looks and feels like Python, if Python consistently used prefix notation.

Does this mean: use Lisp syntax?
Here's what I would like to preserve from Curv's syntax:
* Curried function calls: f x y z
* Infix operators: a + b + c
* Dot notation: a.b.c
* Mixfix operators:
    if a then b else c
    let a in b
    for a in b while c do d

There is a conflict between eliminating optional parentheses, and infix
arithmetic operators. Both are part of standard math notation, it's hard to
have infix without the optional parens. Eg, to explain associativity, you say
    (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

So, if the ability to display Curv programs using traditional math notation
is important (I think it is) then we need optional parens in the syntax tree.

FoC on Lisp Syntax
------------------
Konrad Hinsen:
I couldn't write any Lisp code (mostly Scheme and Emacs Lisp these days)
without paredit in Emacs, And like @Ivan Reese, I set parens to a faint color
so they don't dominate visually. I am much more efficient writing this than e.g.
Python, although I have probably written 10x more Python code than all Lisps
taken together.

Doug Moen:
@Konrad Hinsen Why are you much more efficient writing Lisp than Python?
Inquiring language designers need to know!

William Taysom:
@Doug Moen I'd say really getting a concrete syntax down cold takes a while.

Konrad Hinsen:
@Doug Moen Uniformity of syntax is one aspect. In Python you have parentheses,
indentation, and square brackets being used in different concepts for the same
purpose: establishing a tree structure.  The other aspect is tool support.
With paredit in Emacs, I almost think in terms of paredit operations rather
than in terms of characters. It goes a long way towards structural editing from
my point of view.

Stathis Sideris:
Without adding anything new, I’d like to add myself as someone with long Lisp
exposure (about 8 years of Clojure) who also feels much more efficient/at ease
with the uniformity of Lisp syntax + paredit’s structural editing.

(The learning curve for a complex new syntax could partially account for why
node-and-wire is popular with visual arts programming tools.)
