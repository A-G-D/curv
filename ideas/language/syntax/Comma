Comma vs Semicolon
==================
I don't provide a clear model of the difference between comma vs semicolon.
The documentation is unclear about when one vs the other is even legal.
If a Curv coding style prescribes when to use one vs the other, what would
it prescribe? (The rules should be context free, so they can be automated
by a curvfmt program.)

The classic Curv semantics for the ; operator are messed up in the unreleased
master branch, because 'let' no longer accepts an arbitrary definition
as its first argument. This is because I rebelled against the original
design of allowing statements and recursive definitions to be combined
in a compound recursive definition, using the ; operator. I didn't want
statements in the head of a 'let': I didn't want to document that: I wanted
a more clear distinction between 'let' and 'do'.

Now I must decide how semicolon should work, taking into account:
 * need for embedded debug/assert statements in a module
 * the fact that semicolon is currently an operator, and that you can type
   'stmt;stmt' or 'defn;defn' at top level in the REPL.

STATUS:
All of the suggested syntax extensions are implemented.
Theories 1, 2 and 3 may be used as coding styles, but we don't enforce one
style and prohibit the other two. I still don't know which style to promote
as the standard.

0. Embedded Tests (Done)
------------------------
In old Curv, you just embed statements in a compound definition,
mixed with the definitions. But I didn't like the syntax. I felt it was
confusing.

How does this work in Rust? Like this:
    fn sqrt(number: f64) -> Result<f64, String> {
        if number >= 0.0 {
            Ok(number.powf(0.5))
        } else {
            Err("negative floats don't have square roots".to_owned())
        }
    }
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[test]
        fn test_sqrt() -> Result<(), String> {
            let x = 4.0;
            assert_eq!(sqrt(x)?.powf(2.0), x);
            Ok(())
        }
    }
The tests are ignored until you run 'cargo test'.

In Rust, you just embed a test in a list of definitions, just like you
could do in Curv. The tests are specially marked. Maybe that's all I need.

The phrase 'test <stmt>' is a definition that creates zero bindings, but
executes the <stmt> as a side effect. Translating the Rust code:
    sqrt n = if (n >= 0) n^0.5 else error("sqrt of negative number"),
    test (assert(sqrt 4 == 2)),

The 'test' operator makes it more explicit what code is doing, which
is good for human factors.

Semantically, the ';' operator no longer combines definitions with statements,
thus its specification is simpler. There is no guaranteed relative order of
evaluation of a set of test definitions within a compound recursive
definition (which is part of what makes ';' simpler).

Nested Definitions?
-------------------
In classic Curv, any phrase with a semantic meaning can be parenthesized.
Therefore a definition can be parenthesized, and a compound definition
(constructed with the semicolon operator) can be parenthesized.
And that means you can write nested definitions, where
    (a=1;(b=2;(c=3));d=4)
is equivalent to
    a=1;b=2;c=3;d=4

Although this seems useless, I'll note that imperative languages have always
supported nested statements and nested compound statements, all the way back
to Algol. And it works for exactly the same reasons (it just falls out from
a simple set of rules). There's a bit more practical justification: you can
use the nesting to delimit nested lexical scopes, which is not applicable
to Curv nested definitions.

Because it seems useless, I've disabled this feature in `let` (in the main
branch, not released yet). But it still works in other contexts where
recursive definitions are legal (modules, top level definitions). I thought
getting rid of nested definitions would simplify the language.

Now I'd like to suggest some reasons for preserving the "feature":
 * In some cases you may need to parenthesize a definition, for grouping:
   because ; or , has the lowest precedence. This happens with the trailing
   argument to 'where' (which is being deprecated), and it arises in the
   MixFix proposal. Either I maintain the general rule that definitions can
   be parenthesized, or I introduce parens as special required syntax in
   specific ad-hoc situations (like the trailing argument to 'where').
   I would prefer a design where parens are only used for grouping, and
   never for anything else.
 * If a module contains a huge set of definitions, then you want to
   organize it into sections -- or even a general hierarchy, with tree nodes
   that can be opened/closed using a folding editor -- even though the
   actual module namespace is not nested. Nested definitions provide the
   syntax for exactly this.
 * Once I introduce structured comments, a comment attached to a nested
   parenthesized compound definition documents the set of definitions
   within the parens, which syntactically distinguishes it from a comment
   that applies to a specific simple definition.
 
Theory 1: semicolon operator (just use semicolon)
-------------------------------------------------
The ; operator joins statements into a compound statement.
    [ statement ]           // list comprehension
    { statement }           // record comprehension
    do statement in expr    // do expression
    ( statement )           // grouping

The ; operator is overloaded to join recursive definitions into a
compound definition.
    { definition }              // module
    let definition in phrase    // let phrase

As in Theory 0, you can't mix statements and definitions.

In the REPL, you can type 'stmt;stmt' as a compound statement,
or you can type 'defn;defn' as a compound recursive definition,
with no surrounding parens and no surrounding operation to interpret
the meaning of the ';'.

The , is superfluous. It is not an operator: it is ad-hoc syntax that
works as a synonym for ; in some contexts but not others.
You can't write 'a,b,c' at the top level in the REPL: it is a syntax error.

For simplicity, just use semicolon.

The problem is that it looks weird, compared to conventional languages.
   [a; b; c]  vs [a, b, c] in many top languages, and in JSON.
   {a: 1; b: 2} vs {a: 1, b: 2} in Javascript, {"a":1, "b":2} in Python, etc.
   'let a=1; b=2 in ...' is okay.
   'do stmt1; stmt2 in ...' is okay. (Many imperative languages use semicolon.)

Theory 1a: comma and semicolon are interchangeable
--------------------------------------------------
At least it's an easy rule to remember.

The deprecated syntax (a,b,c) for constructing a list must be removed.
(a,b,c) is no longer an expression: it is either a compound definition
or a compound statement.
    max(x,y)
       ^^^^^
    ERROR: Not an expression.
    The syntax '(a,b,c)' is not an expression.
    Try using the expression '[a,b,c]' to construct a list.

This doesn't provide any guidance on coding style. When does `curvfmt`
use commas and when does it use semicolons?

Theory 2: comma and semicolon operators
---------------------------------------
We introduce a principled semantic distinction between , and ;

Since ; is overloaded, why not use different operators for those two cases?
  ; is imperative sequencing: it joins statements into a compound statement.
    It is non-commutative (but associative).
  , joins recursive definitions into a compound definition.
    It is both commutative and associative.

do a; b; c in expr
[a; b; c]
{a: 1; b: 2}
{a=1, b=2}
let a=1, b=2 in phrase

In the REPL, comma and semicolon are both standalone operators
for constructing compound recursive definitions and compound statements
respectively.

This is simple, logical, consistent.

It doesn't give me that "mainstream-looking syntax" that I wanted.
Perhaps there is a conflict between rigorous orthogonality and formal 
simplicity, on one hand, and "frame-based" language design, where each
feature signals what "frame" (cognitive linguistics) it is a part of.

This breaks the ability to put parens around a compound recursive definition.
Maybe we need to remove the (a,b,c) list syntax first?
Actually, no, with #0 implemented, we can interpret (def1,def2) as a compound
definition and still treat (expr1,expr) as a list.

A generalized 'local' definition would allow
    local (a=1, b=2);
for simultaneous or parallel definition (like 'let' in Scheme),
and that *is* mainstream syntax (as opposed to 'local (a=1; b=2)').
Possible use case:
    local (x=y, y=x);

Theory 3: ,/; mean unspecified/sequential order of evaluation
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is an extension of Theory 2, with more meanings for comma, and more
conventional syntax. Comma now means "unspecified evaluation order".

do a; b; c in expr   -- statements must be executed in order
[a,b,c]              -- subexpressions are independent, any eval order works
[a;b;c]              -- statements must execute in sequential order
{a:1,b:2}            -- field defs are independent and disjoint, any eval order
{f1;f2;f3}           -- sequential record comprehension, override semantics
{a=1,b=2}            -- order independent definitions
let a=1, b=2 in ph   -- order independent definitions

In this theory,
 * Comma is not commutative in all contexts. Instead, the order
   of evaluation of the arguments is not fixed to be sequential.
 * Semicolon is the imperative sequencing operator.
   Side effects in earlier statements affect the output of later statements.
 * A new feature is added. {a:1,b:2,a:3} aborts due to a duplicate definition.
   This contrasts with the override semantics of {a:1;b:2;a:3}.

Do we still have a comma operator? In what contexts is a parenthesized
comma list meaningful?

This is a better match to conventional notation.

It is more complicated.
The semicolon operator is unchanged from theory 2.
But comma has a different meaning in list, record and definition contexts.
 * In an unconstrained context, 'a,b,c' is a compound recursive definition.
   Eg, a=1,b=2 is a REPL command, just like Theory 2.

This leads to a better partition of the language into dialects, and
a better partition of the documentation.
In the documentation, the comma forms will be part of the high level,
functional subset, while the semicolon forms will be documented only
in Debug Actions and Imperative. [a;b] and {a;b} are list and record
comprehensions, documented in Imperative. In List and Record, I document
[a,b] and {a,b}. For lists, the subphrases are expr and ...expr.
For records, the subphrases are id:expr and ...expr.

In pattern matching, only comma patterns make sense for lists and records,
not semicolon patterns. A list or record pattern element matches a single
element of the argument, or it is a ... pattern.

In the evaluator, [a,b,c] evaluates each element as an expression, not as
a statement (unless the ... operator is used). This fixes polybug.
(Actually, the bug is moved to the code that handles list comprehensions.)

Old Theory: comma separates data structure elements
---------------------------------------------------
Allow ',' to be used, instead of ';',
in any context where we are separating items in a collection.
 * Allow commas in scoped record constructors.
     {x=1, y=2}
 * Allow commas at the top level of a list or record comprehension,
   even with local defs.
     [local x=1, while (x>=0) (x; x:=x-1)]

Theory: semicolon is imperative sequencing; comma separates independent elements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or: semicolon separates statements, comma separates expressions.

There are a number of contexts in Curv where I want to know, statically,
how many elements are in a list constructor, just by counting expressions.

  One such context is issuing error messages. If a list constructor is given
  as an argument, and one of the element subexpressions yields a bad value,
  I'd like to underline just the bad subexpression.

  Another context is SubCurv. A list of N expressions compiles into an array
  or tuple of size N, but a list of statements requires more work (and isn't
  actually supported right now).

  A list of statements containing assignment statements is particularly
  tricky, since the environment of each expression is determined dynamically
  by the side effects of the previous expression. In this case, it seems
  quite appropriate to use semicolons for sequencing, as distinct from
  commas, which imply the elements of the list literal are independent
  and can be evaluated in any order.

So comma means order independent (or parallel) evaluation, while semicolon
means sequential evaluation.

I've considered the idea that the only elements in a comma-separated
list constructor are expressions and '...' phrases. (Many popular languages
have this syntax: Python, Javascript, etc.) Whereas a list comprehension,
employing imperative programming constructs like local variable definitions,
assignments, conditional statements and loops, must use semicolons.
 * But, creating this distinction and then allowing ... phrases in a
   comma-separated list constructor has always felt weird, since I classify
   those as statements, and semantically they are value generators (producing
   a sequence of values whose count is only known at run time).
 * But, I can say that ... phrases do not introduce order dependency,
   so don't conflict with the meaning of comma as order independent.
 * Other languages support the equivalent of ... in list constructors,
   without supporting conditionals and for loops (which can also be
   order independent if they don't contain assignments).

So this implies:
 * comma in a set of recursive definitions (let, module)
      let a=1, b=2 in ...
      {a=1, b=2}
 * comma in an unscoped record literal like {a:1, b:2}
   and in a list literal like [1,2],
   and including the `...` operator: [a,b,...c]
 * semicolon in a compound statement (stmt1; stmt2)
   and in a list comprehension that contains local/:=/if/for/while
   and in a record comprehension that contains local/:=/if/for/while
     {a:1; if (need_b) b:2}

If I am segmenting the language into functional and imperative, then
I could say that semicolon is restricted to the imperative sublanguage.

The goal is to make Curv easier to document and understand.
Does this advance that goal?
 * We split Curv into high/low or basic/advanced dialects.
   Put the imperative sublanguage into "advanced", together with comprehensions.
   The basic dialect will just have simple list and record syntax [a,b,c],
   {a:1,b:2}, {a=1,b=2}.

Perhaps the semicolon operator is tied to the semantics of statement
abstraction? (Not worked out yet).
