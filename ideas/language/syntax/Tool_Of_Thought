Notation as a Tool of Thought
=============================

Why Haskell notation is better than Lisp notation.

 * Infix is better than prefix for equational reasoning.
 * Pattern matching is better than conditionals.
 * Type declarations organize your thoughts around how your data is structured
   and which cases you need to handle in algorithms over those types.
 * "The difference between (1 2 3) and (quote (1 2 3)) is subtle, and it
   inevitably confuses students. In particular, it plays havoc with the
   substitution model of evaluation." Wadler's problem is that the printed
   representation of a list is not a constructor expression that evaluates
   to the list. Whereas in Curv, all values print as constructor expressions:
   [1,2,3] prints as [1,2,3].
 * Lazy lists are easier to use, have better mathematical properties in Haskell.
