Objective Smalltalk Syntax
--------------------------
Interesting because it is C + the Objective C runtime using Smalltalk syntax.

Objective Smalltalk uses slightly modified Smalltalk syntax.
{...} instead of [...] for blocks.
Type annotations using <typename>.
[No real documentation is available.]

Higher Order Methods is a coding technique analogous to Currying
for writing terse point-free code and bulk operations using Smalltalk syntax
and message sends. It's actually cool. Eg, n factorial:
   (1 to: n) reduce * 1
