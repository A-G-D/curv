Ideas for non-backward-compatible syntax changes.

Pipeline Precedence
-------------------
What is the precedence of >> relative to other left-associative infix operators?
* lower than postfix expressions. The left arg of >> is normally postfix.
* a >> b * c --- (a >> b) * c
* a >> b + c --- (a >> b) + c
* a >> b == c -- (a >> b) == c
* a >> b && c -- (a >> b) && c
* a >> b `foo` c -- (a >> b) `foo` c, in most cases, unless `foo` returns func
* -a >> b -- (-a) >> b

Pipeline precedence should be between power and product.
>> :: @ have the same precedence.

What about `foo` precedence? Currently it is very low, between ritem and
disjunction. It was intended to have the same precedence as >> so that you
could write cube >> colour red `union` sphere >> move [1,2,3]
ie use `foo` as a pipeline operator.

I really wanna collapse all the left-associative precedences between pipeline
and product into a single precedence level. The result will be:
    <list> , ;
    <item>
    <pipeline>  >> `foo` || && == + * ^ @
    <prefix>
    <postfix>

Note: If index values become functions, then a>>b and a@b will have the same
semantics *and* same precedence in expression context.

Lambda Precedence
-----------------
Maybe change -> to have postfix precedence on the left and item on the right.
Then you write
    some pipeline >> x -> rest of pipeline with x captured
This is a tradeoff since parameters with infix pattern operators
now need parentheses, this affects match expressions.

Postfix Expressions
-------------------
There is an ease-of-use issue in expressions like:
1. `abs a.x`
2. `f a[0]`
3. `move cross(a,b) cube`
4. offset -1
The parsing of function arguments doesn't match the use of whitespace in these
examples.

I have four alternate plans for resolving this issue:
A. **Warning messages for misleading expression syntax**, when the whitespace
   between tokens suggests a different grouping than what the grammar provides.
B. **Lua-like function call syntax**, where we drop support for `f 42` and `f x`
   style function calls, requiring parentheses in these cases:
   `f(42)` and `f(x)`. This eliminates the ambiguity in all 4 cases.
   Argument expressions must be delimited: (...) [...] {...} "..."
   More verbose, especially curried function calls like f(a)(b)(c).
   In ReasonML, f(a,b,c) == f(a)(b)(c).
C. **White-space sensitive expression parsing**.
   A big can of worms.
D. A function argument is either a self delimiting primary
   like (...) [...] {...} "..." or it is a high-precedence
   Tpostfix expression beginning with an identifier.
   Almost as terse as C, without whitespace-sensitive parsing.
   Details of grammar?

Tight Control Syntax
--------------------
In newer languages with a C-like syntax, we have moved to a new syntax for
control statements like `if`, `while`, etc. (For example: Go, Rust, Swift).
* The statement argument is required to be braced, as in
    while cond { statements }
  This avoids a mistake in C where the braces are optional, and if you forget
  and write multiple statements indented after the `while`, it won't be parsed
  properly, but the compiler won't catch this.
* It also avoids the dangling else ambiguity. After an `else` is either a
  braced statement block, or an `if` statement.
* C function definitions have always required the body to be braced, so maybe
  this is more consistent.

I can mimic this syntax style in Curv (if I break backward compatibility)
by making these syntax elements into primary expressions: then-part or
else-part of an if, body of a while, body of an anonymous function.

This means that if, while and -> become high precedence operators.
What are the consequences, for embedding uses of these operations in
larger expressions?

Anonymous Functions
-------------------
Some languages with functional programming features have weird syntax
for passing an anonymous function as the last argument of a function call.
It makes function calls that mimic control structures look more like the syntax
for built-in control structures. (Ruby, Scala, Swift, Nim)

Swift closure expression:
    { s1, s2 in s1 > s2 }   --   like: (s1, s2)->(s1 > s2)
Trailing closure syntax for function calls:
    f(a,b,{...}) can be written as f(a,b){...}
This looks like a special case of the curried function call syntax in Reason.

Mixfix Operators
----------------
User defined mixfix operators, based on Tight Control Syntax and Syntax D.
This gets us closer to Lisp-like extensible syntax.
* We do not permit a bare identifier or numeral to be a function argument.
  Function arguments are delimited primary expressions like (...) [...] {...}.
* `if (x > y) then (x) else (y)` is sugar for `if_then_else(x > y, x, y)`.
* `if (x > 0) then (1) else if (x < 0) then (-1) else (0)`
  is sugar for `if_then_else(x > 0, 1, if_then_else(x < 0, -1, 0))`.
* A mixfix operator can be selected from a record, eg
  `R.if (a) then (b) else (c)`

How does mixfix syntax combine with postfix syntax?

term ::= num | id | postfix | mixfix

postfix ::= id | arg | postfix arg | postfix . id
arg ::= (...) | [...] | {...} | "..."

A mixfix is 'id arg | id arg id arg | id arg id arg id arg ...'
except that the initial id can be a postfix whose first and last token are id,
and the final arg can be a mixfix.

So now,
1. `abs a.x` -- illegal, unless an arg follows
2. `f a[0]` -- legal
3. `move cross(a,b) cube` -- illegal, unless an arg follows
   move cross(a,b) cube(3) is move(cross(a,b) cube(3))
                           is move(cross_cube((a,b),3))
4. offset -1 -- illegal

The coding style will use white space differently for function calls vs
mixfix calls: f(x) vs f (x) g (y). This syntax will be confusing, has potential
for "ambiguous whitespace", just as in previous section.

Intuitively, postfix has higher visual precedence than mixfix.
Using a mixfix as an argument to an arithmetic operator like + is also weird.
* The mixfix notation is partially inspired by Smalltalk and Self, where mixfix
  has lower precedence that left associative symbolic operators.
* The mixfix notation is partially inspired by the mixfix operators in <ritem>.

What if I put mixfix into <ritem>? And impose whitespace requirements for
parsing postfix and mixfix?

-----------------
What about:
  if (a) then b(c)
  if (a) then b.c
  if (a) then (b)(c)
  f (a)(b)(c)
Let's say: the final argument in a mixfix form is

arg ::= (...) | [...] | {...} | "..."
arg_postfix ::= arg | arg_postfix arg | arg_postfix '.' id
id_postfix ::= id | id_postfix arg | id_postfix '.' id
