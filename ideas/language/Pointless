The Pointless programming language: https://ptls.dev

It's a simple, dynamically typed, almost pure functional language.
I like the syntax in some ways better than Curv.
Here are some interesting points.

--------------------
-- comment syntax --
--------------------
incr(x) = x + 1  -- a function definition

if _ then _ else _
_ and _
_ or _
not _

f(x,y) is function call syntax. The parens are required.
f(x) is a curried function call: not all arguments specified.
a[i] is array indexing.

foo is a variable name.
Foo is a label (aka symbol value).
Foo(a,b,c) is a labelled tuple.
Foo{a=1,b=2} is a labelled object (objects are like records in Curv)

Labels and labelled structures are clean, simple syntax for inventing new types.
The closest correspondence in Curv is #Foo, {Foo: [a,b,c]} and {Foo: {a=1,b=2}}.
However, *every* value has a label; there are labels for each built-in
data type. is(label,value) is a predicate for type classification.
