Requirement: a kind of procedure that takes one or more locatives as
by-reference arguments, then reads and writes these locatives using
statement syntax (as if the locative parameters were local variables
defined using 'local').

Let's say that we use named arguments: the model is that the procedure
argument is a record.

Semantically, a procedure like this is a mapping from a record to another
record with the same fields.
