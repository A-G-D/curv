Tagged Data: a representation for Application Data Types
========================================================
Many simple functional languages provide a bureaucracy-free method of
directly constructing instances of "discriminated union types", without
the requirement to first define a type. These are tagged values.

Haskell discriminated union
    data T = Foo | Bar a

The syntax requirements are:
 * construct 'Foo', a tagged value without a payload
 * construct 'Bar x', a tagged value with a payload
 * pattern matching of tagged values, binding payload to a variable

There should also be a method of defining a predicate or type for recognizing
the values of an informal discriminated union. This can be done post-hoc,
after there is already code constructing and using these tagged values.

The benefit of this approach is extreme simplicity.
It's perfect when all code is written by a single user or small cohesive group.
The drawbacks come from the lack of sophistication and bureaucracy:
 * You can't certify a value as being a valid instance of an application data
   type using an unforgeable 'brand' verifying that the value was constructed
   using approved operations.
 * At scale, there will arise a need for 'namespaces' or hierarchical tags.
   This will arise if Curv gets a large user base of people writing and
   sharing code libraries, each with their own tags, that need to be distinct
   from tags created by other authors.

Symbols and Singleton Records
-----------------------------
In Curv, we can satisfy these requirements using symbols and singleton records.
No need for any new language features!
    #Foo
    {Bar: a}

The picker field of a picker predicate uses tagged data. This picker field
never contains anyone other than a picker descriptor, so the tags do not
need to be globally unique. In this context, the encoding works fine.

In the following, I speculate on using this encoding for application types
that need to be globally distinct, since shapes, colours and characters
are displayed differently from other values. This is more problematic.

For shapes, we can use
  { shape:
      { distance: Function,
        colour: Function,
        bounds: [Vec3,Vec3],
        is_2d: Bool,
        is_3d: Bool
      }
  }
For colours,
  { colour: Vec3 }
For lenses,
  { lens:
      { get: Function,
        set: Function
      }
  }

For characters, we could use:
  { char: 97 }
And our list of primitive data types becomes:
  number, symbol, list, record, function

For complex application data types that support multiple interfaces,
we can use multiple top-level fields in the tagged data representation.
For example, the result of `cube` contains:
  { call: Function,
    shape:
      { distance: Function,
        colour: Function,
        bounds: Tuple[Vec3,Vec3],
        is_2d: Bool,
        is_3d: Bool
      }
  }

Rationale
---------
This is much simpler than other proposals. No new language mechanisms.

The shape and colour types can initially be graphical types using the
current mechanism: the Curv core recognizes the tags. Later, an extensible
mechanism involving a #graphical tag could be invented.

To examine the fields of a graphical value, use `...cube` in the REPL.

The type name tags make ADT records easier to understand on inspection,
and they also make the ADT representation more extensible. It's easier to
add user metadata to a shape, with less concern for name conflicts.

If this representation proves to be inefficient, it can be fixed at a lower
level without disturbing the abstract value space. Singleton records could have
a more efficient representation. The new Type mechanism could be used to provide
an efficient representation for ADTs. And so on.

That seems to be a Curv design principle now. Design the abstract values
so that they make sense at a high level, then design a fast and efficient
memory representation separate from that.

System Types
------------
A "system type" is a type that is treated specially by the core.
Any type that is printed or displayed differently.
    Shape
    Colour
    Char

Some types are "open", equivalent to non-final classes or interfaces in an
OOP language, or equivalent to a Haskell type class. They are Record types;
You can extend the type by adding new record fields, creating a subtype.

Some types are "closed": they are Struct types and cannot be extended.

From the above list, Shape is open while Colour and Char are closed.

If we have multiple open system types, then we will need a global ordering
on these types to determine which special display logic is used. This handles
the case of a weird value that contains the union of fields from two open
system types. This problem is resolved by adding a trait (top level field)
called #display or #graphical to open system types.

Equality
--------
The branded value proposal provides reasonable semantics for equality to
ADTs. With this proposal, closed types like Colour and Char (with a fixed
set of non-function data fields) have meaningful equality, but open types
like Shape do not. The Shape type doesn't need equality, and in the general
case, open types don't need equality. So this is not a big problem.

Characters
----------
Right now, the legal range for supported unicode code points is 1..127.
So any singleton 'char' record whose element is not an integer in 1..127
will not be recognized as a character. The 'Char' constructor will report
an error, but you can create a 'counterfeit' char record that isn't recognized
as a character value. Eg, Char 0 is an error, but {char:0} is {char:0}.
This is a consequence of not branding ADT instances with their constructor.
There is less structure imposed on values, which simplifies the language
design, and simplifies the mental model of what a value is, but also provides
less "assistance" to users.
