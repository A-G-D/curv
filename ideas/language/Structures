* Quoted identifiers.

Quoted Identifiers.
-------------------
'hello world' is a quoted identifier. Use cases:
* Permit embedded spaces and punctuation characters in identifiers.
  Useful if identifiers are shown in the GUI, via parametric records.
* Permit reserved words like 'if' and '_' to be identifiers.
* In Cue, within a scoped record literal,
  a field named _foo is private, but '_foo' is public. Maybe?

There is no reason to support control characters in quoted identifiers,
only printable ASCII (32-126) for now.

Escape sequences? Note they have to be resolved prior to semantic analysis.
For now, the only character that would need to be escaped is `'`. Later,
if Unicode is supported, we might want numeric code-point escape sequences.
Use case: include Unicode characters in the GUI, but the source code
remains ASCII for ease of editing. Eg, '$[0x263A]'.
Initially, I'll only support two escape sequences: `$-` and `$.`.
If Unicode happens, I'll add numeric code-point escapes.

I'm not sure about interpolating named characters, because how do you
include a library of character names prior to semantic analysis?

Symbols.
--------
* Symbols are abstract values, distinguished only by their name.
  They only support equality and conversion to and from strings.
  #foo is a symbol; it prints as #foo; it is only equal to itself.
* #'hello world' is a symbol with nonstandard name. Used with dropdown_menu
  proposal: `dropdown_menu[#'Value Noise', #'Fractal Noise']`.
  (Note, not #"hello world" as that conflicts with the proposal for adding
   Swift5 string literal syntax.)
* Define true=#true, false=#false, null=#null.
* #foo is a pattern.
* Thus, #true and #false are the literal pattern syntax for booleans.
  (An alternative is for true and false to be keywords.)
* Record fields are symbols internally.
* `is_symbol x`

Number patterns.
----------------
* <numeral> is a pattern.
* +<numeral> and -<numeral> are patterns.
* `inf` is the numeral for infinity. It is a keyword.
  * `#inf` is not preferred, I don't want to imply that infinity is a symbol.
    I don't want is_symbol(inf) to be true.
  * Scheme uses `+inf.0`. That's cryptic.
  * Most languages drop the ball, don't support a way to write infinity.
    The corollary is that people mostly won't care what I choose.

String patterns.
----------------
"foo"

Lists.
------
No change.

Sets.
-----
* The Python syntax {1,2,3} is great, but {} now denotes both an empty set
  and an empty record. In Python, {} is an empty dictionary,
  and set([]) is the empty set. In SETL, a map is a set of ordered pairs:
  this is consistent with the {...} syntax for sets. But how do I determine
  that a given set of ordered pairs is actually a map without copying the set
  into a hash table? That seems expensive.
* Thus, Set is disjoint from Record and Map.
* Syntax: #[1, 2, 3]
* A set pattern is a set literal containing constant patterns.
  You can't bind variables.

Function Equality.
------------------
Functions don't support proper equality. Semantics that I want:
1. You can't put a Function value in a Set or use it as a Map key (error).
   * Thus, you can't put Shapes into a Set.
2. If you match a Function value against a non-Function pattern,
   the match fails (no error).
3. As a corollary, for the proposed `==x` pattern,
   * Error if `x` is a function.
   * No match if the value being matched is a function.
4. Non-function predicates return false for function arguments.
   Eg, `is_bool(max) == false`.

What are the semantics of `a==b` for functions?
a. The current implementation is: all functions are equal.
   It's an equivalence relation. It seems inconsistent with the above semantics.
b. If a function appears as either argument of `==`, then an error.
   This seems consistent with the idea that Function is not an equality type,
   and it seems consistent with the equivalence relation axioms.
   However, suppose we define
      is_bool a = a==#true || a==#false;
   Then `is_bool(max)` is an error, contrary to the requirements.
c. If two functions are compared, an error. If a function and non-function
   are compared, false. This is compatible with the `is_bool` definition,
   and seems the most consistent with the required semantics above.
   It seems to violate the `a==a` axiom of an equivalence relation.
   (It is impossible to implement a==a for functions, if we want operational
   or mathematical equivalence.)
We will use 'c'.

Records vs Maps.
----------------
Is a Record just a Map where the keys are Symbols?
* It seems elegant & mathematical. SETL and Cell work this way.
  Consider a map M where all the keys are symbols, and an isomorphic record R.
  What's the difference?
* Ah, but records and maps are used differently.
  A record type is a set of name/type pairs, which constitute an API.
  * Records are indexed using dot notation: R.F
  * A record with a `call` field is callable; that's part of its API.
  A map type is Map(KeyType,ValueType).
  * In popular dynamic languages, maps are indexed using the same syntax
    as arrays: M[K]. A map with integer keys is like a sparse array.
So Records are not Maps.

Maps.
-----
* #{ key1 => value1, ... }
  Like Ruby syntax but with a #, so that #{} is the empty map.
* M[K] looks up key K in map M, returns the corresponding value.
* Each binding in a map pattern is `expr => pattern`. All of the keys
  in the map value being matched must match one of the keys in the bindings.

Records.
--------
Internally, field names are represented by Symbols.
* `fields aRecord` returns a Set of Symbols.

Right now, we overload the `:` statement as <string>:<expr> and <ident>:<expr>.
New design, we use
    <symbol-expr> => <expr>
to generate a field from a symbol expression, and use
    <pattern> : <expr>
to generate fields by binding against a pattern.
This frees up string literals to be used as literal patterns.
* We also need quoted identifiers, to satisfy the use case of non-standard
  identifiers as field names.
* The need for => to construct fields with computed names is questionable,
  once maps are added.

Generic structure operations.
-----------------------------
S!I
S is a list/string/record/map and I is integer/integer/symbol/value.

S!
Here ! is a postfix operator converting S to a function of an index value.

fetch [i1,i2,i3] S      or S >> fetch path
amend path newvalue S   or S >> amend path newvalue
