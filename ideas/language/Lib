`lib` is a builtin lazy record value.
Its fields are the *.curv files in the directory PREFIX/lib/curv.
(So this is a preview of directory syntax.)

TODO:
* Implement Dir_Record and a directory syntax importer.
* Implement `lib`.

The System object contains the libdir (which is also used to load std.curv).
On first attempt to access the fields of `lib`, we read libdir and populate
a dictionary. But reading the files is still lazy. The `lib` object is owned
by the System object.

The libdir is configurable, using $CURV_LIBDIR.

Laziness of the `lib` object.
Dir_Record is a subclass of Structure, which has a virtual interface.
Dir_Record::getfield() needs a reference to libdir.
Maybe use `openat` and use a file descriptor for libdir?
Note that I need the directory name for the File_Source objects.
