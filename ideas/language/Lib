`lib` is a builtin lazy record value.
Its fields are the *.curv files in the directory PREFIX/lib/curv.
(So this is a preview of directory syntax.)

TODO:
* Implement Dir_Record and a directory syntax importer.
* Implement `lib`.

The System object contains the `lib` object, which is constructed at
System construction time from the libdir, as an instance of Dir_Record.
The fields are populated at this time by reading the directory.
(Meaning that Dir_Record::hasfield(sym) cannot fail.) But the files are not
read until they are first referenced (meaning that Dir_Record::getfield(sym,cx)
can fail during file i/o).

The libdir is configurable, using $CURV_LIBDIR.
