lib: a hierarchical module namespace for the standard library
=============================================================
Curv is meant to have a large standard library that provides a rich set
of primitives for constructing shapes. The new `lib` feature allows these
primitives to be organized into a hierarchical module namespace, with modules
that are only loaded into memory on first reference.

Suppose that `web_colour` is a standard library module that contains all of
the HTML5 colour names. Then here is how you can use it:

    lib.web_colour.peach

    let
        include lib.web_colour;
    in
        peach

    let
        wc = lib.web_colour;
    in
        wc.peach

Here are some ideas for new library modules.

web_colour
    Contains all of the HTML5/CSS colour names.
    Also contains the function rgb(r,g,b), where the arguments are
    numbers in the range 0 to 255.
blend
    A richer set of blending primitives.
    @gsohler is working on a pull request to add the Mercury blend primitives.
noise
    Contains math functions that hash their arguments and generate pseudo-random
    numbers that visually represent different kinds of noise. Eg,
    * white noise (uniformly distributed random numbers).
    * value noise.
    * gradient noise.
    * fractal noise (fractal brownian motion). Useful for smoke, clouds,
      mountains, procedural textures.
    * cellular noise, aka Worley noise, aka Voronoi noise.
fractal
    Primitives for making fractals, perhaps based on Mandelbulber
    and the example code in Fragmentarium.
texture
    Primitives for making 2D and 3D procedural textures.
    (It will use lib.noise.)
engraving & embossing
    Primitives for modifying the surface of an object.
lattice
    Regular lattices, like cubic and tetrahedron/octahedron.
    A "Voronoi" lattice based on cellular noise.
repetition & space folding
polyhedron
