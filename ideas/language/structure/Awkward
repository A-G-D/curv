Awkward Arrays
==============
old: https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array
new: https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0

Generalizes the array-language operations on uniform rectangle arrays
to also operate on ragged arrays and tables (list of records).
A bit like APL for JSON.

Supports efficient bulk operations on heterogenous data.
A GPU accelerated implementation is in the works.
The old version is in Python.
The new version, Awkward 1.0, has a C++ core with no Python dependencies.
It has a simpler, more uniform API and a more efficient implementation.

Abstract:
  Awkward Array is a library for nested, variable-sized data, including
  arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using
  NumPy-like idioms.

  Arrays are dynamically typed, but operations on them are compiled and fast.
  Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular
  and generalizes when they're not.

See: Ragged Tensors in TensorFlow.

What are the semantics of the bulk data operations?
 * Anything interesting not found in J or K?
 * Which array operations generalize to work on records?
     'num' and 'sum' don't work on top level records,
     but they do work on tables (lists of records).

How to invoke awkward 1.0 from Python:
  pip install awkward1
