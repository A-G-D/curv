Awkward Arrays
==============
old: https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array
new: https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0

Generalizes the array-language operations on uniform rectangle arrays
to also operate on ragged arrays and tables (list of records).
A bit like APL for JSON.

Supports efficient bulk operations on heterogenous data.
A GPU accelerated implementation is in the works.
The old version is Python.
The new version has a C++ core with no Python dependencies.
