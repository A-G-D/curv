K adverbs

over        f/x     reduce f x
scan        f\x
each        f'x     map f x
eachleft    x f\:y  mapl f x    x ~op y
eachright   x f/:y  mapr f x    x op~ y
eachprior   x f':y

The most general infix syntax for adverbs is ` syntax.
Adverbs are ordinary combinators. For example,
    `mapl mod`
    `amap2 1 and`
As a shortcut,
    ` <postfix> <infix-operator> `
is an abbreviation of
    ` <postfix> '<infix-operator>' `
Eg, `mapl*`

I have encountered several uses for eachleft/eachright in Curv code.
Are symbolic adverb operators a good idea for Curv?
    *f x        each (or map)
    *>f [x,y]   each right
    <*f [x,y]   each left
The [[Tilde_Dmap_Smap]] proposal looks like this:
    f ~ x       each
    x `f`~ y    each right
    x ~`f` y    each left

0..999 ~`mod` [3,5] ~~== 0 >> or >> where >> sum
0..999 >> `<*mod`[3,5] >> `eq`0 >> or >> where >> sum
0..999 `<*mod`[3,5] `eq`0 >>or >>where >>sum

What adverbs do other languages define?

Scheme sfri-1 defines many: https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html
So does Haskell.
Clojure.

In Scala, /: is foldLeft and :\ is foldRight.
