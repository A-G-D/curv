Boxed Values and Null
=====================
Algebraic structures that appear everywhere in programming.

A box is a trivial data structure that contains a single value.
Boxes are used when there is a need to deal with heterogenous
values of different types or shapes in a uniform way.

When boxes are combined with the special value Null, then you can represent
the presence or absence of a value: an optional value. If the value is present,
put it in a box. If the value is absent, represent that situation using Null.
This representation works even if the value that is present is Null,
because a box containing Null is distinct from Null.

In Curv, we'd need the following:
    box a -- construction
    unbox b -- inspection
    b@unbox := a
    a != box a
    box a == box b iff a == b
    box <pattern> -- pattern matching
    is_box b

Modern APL dialects have boxes. See [[Amap]] for the reasons.
To satisfy these requirements, a box is a rank zero array.
Scalar operations that are generalized to work on arrays also work on boxes.
So,
    box 2 + box 3 == box 5
    box[1,1] + [box[2,3], box[10,20]] == [box[3,4], box[11,21]]

A box is a new container type, how does it interact with Tree Theory?

A simple design that satisfies all requirements *except* the APL requirement is
  box a = [a]
  Null = []
I need to weigh the cost of adding 'box' as a fundamental new container type
vs the benefits. K has essentially the same data model as Curv, and doesn't
provide these kind of boxes. The 'eachleft' and 'eachright' adverbs cover
common use cases for APL boxes. If K doesn't need this concept, then arguably
neither does Curv.
