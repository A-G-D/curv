* Taichi: data abstraction for sparse arrays. automatic differentiation.
  LLVM to CPU or CUDA. Embedded in Python: GPU kernels are written as Python
  code but are statically typed and data parallel.

* Lift: a functional data-parallel IR for high performance GPU code generation
* Rise: successor to Lift, using MLIR

  statically typed, high level, pure functional.

Ideas for Curv:
* staged computation: a dynamically typed language (with first class module
  and type values) is partially evaluated into a statically typed language.
* JIT: statically typed code can be JIT compiled into optimized functions and
  efficient, optimized data structures. If done on the CPU, dynamically typed
  code can call into compiled functions and use compiled data structures.
* Target WebGPU, not CUDA.
* WASM port of Curv? Compile dynamically typed code into WASM modules.
  Which are 1.5-2.1x slower (in V8) than LLVM output.

Spiral

GPUs for performance.
Abstraction by heap allocation can't work on GPUs. Thus, need strong types.
Control of inlining is of central importance, must be part of type system.
Inlining expresses a tradeoff between speed and memory.

A language good enough at propagating information so as to express inlining
guarantees is also powerful enough to express other things, without abstraction
overhead:
 First class types; Structural reflection through pattern matching;
 Interoperability between languages (F# and Cuda);
 First class functions; Tuples as heterogenous lists; First class modules;
 First class layout of data structures;

Statically typed. Powerful type system gives expressiveness of dynamic languages
and speed of C. Staged functional programming. Structural polymorphism and
first class staging. For deep learning.

Automatic type inference, inlining, other optimizations requires restrictions
and heuristics to ensure termination. Languages that automate important parts
of their internals invariably hamstring their expressiveness. Not Spiral.
Spiral is a static language with no restrictions on type inference or
optimizations.

Inlineables; join points. Exposes optimizations as type system polymorphism.
Ties these features together to support guaranteed program termination.
Halting problem is obstacle to bridging expressiveness and performance.
C is what high level languages regress to when they worry about performance.

Inlining by hand is never necessary. The most abstract way of writing a
program is also the optimal one. Spiral abstracts away optimization.

Based on F#.

'2' is a constant (type level)
'dyn 2' is a dynamic value (term level); blocks compile time/partial evaluation
    value is stored in a runtime variable.

'Inlineables' are always inlined. 'inl' is like let but defines an inlineable.
inl x = 2
inl y = dyn 2
inl add a b = a + b

Inlineable functions are dynamically typed. He doesn't use these words though.
This makes compile time evaluation simple and powerful, without the complexity
of the Haskell type system (for example).

met f x = x + 1
'met' means 'method'. This is a non-inlined function? Methods are specialized
to the arguments passed to them.

### Join Points
This is a key concept in Spiral. Nowhere is the term properly defined.

The following are equivalent:
    met f _ = 1
    inl f _ = join 1

Join points allow more fine grained control over inlining.
Maybe 'join' means 'do not inline the following code' within an otherwise
inlined function. This allows you to use 'if' statements to control which
parts of a function are inlined/not inlined.

inl sum l =
    if forall lit_is l then foldl (+) 0 l
    else join foldl (+) 0 (dyn l)
