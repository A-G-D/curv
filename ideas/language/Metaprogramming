Metaprogramming in Curv
=======================
No plan, just some ideas.

Mechanisms:
* Macros (like Scheme/Racket) -- at analysis time
* Reflection and introspection -- at runtime
* Axiom driven optimization using an EGG based optimizer.
  Modules, algebras and theories define the axioms.
* Multi-phase evaluation, partial evaluation.
* C# code generators:

Goals:
* Preserve and support referential transparency, local reasoning,
  equational reasoning.
* Static type checking is pushed out of the core and into libraries.
* Very high level code is transformed into efficient GPU code.
  Push complexity out of the core and into libraries written in Curv.

Implementation:
* Compiler/interpreter data structures are represented as Curv values.
  That's a first step.
