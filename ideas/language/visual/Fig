Functional Interactive Graphics
===============================
This is a malleable software environment, loosely inspired by Smalltalk.
It is:
 * fun & easy to use
 * small, simple, lo fi
 * completely malleable

There is a programming language:
 * simple regular syntax
 * simple data model
 * simple, powerful, orthogonal, composable
 * dynamically typed
 * denotative (pure functional)
 * a simple set of core primitives, everything else built on top

Everything is done from inside an interactive graphical environment, written
in the language itself.

Your "image" is hierarchical persistent data, backed up on the file system
using a directory hierarchy. Directories are records, images are *.png files,
etc. Use git for version control.
