What if Curv used a richer format for source files than plain text?
Maybe something more like a word processor, with support for rich text,
embedded images, automatic reformatting of source code when you resize
the window, etc. Not literally MSWord tho. What about hypertext?

Roam Research is a trendy new hypertext system, popular enough that
multiple open source implementations are underway.

 * Stroll, built on TiddlyWiki. https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html
     Entire database in two files: HTML and JS. Programmable.
 * Org-roam: Enhanced EMACS Org-mode. https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam
     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c
 * DocuWiki and DocuRoam
     PHP, no database.

 * Athens. Web server based, distributed, full Roam implementation.

What are the benefits of integrating Curv with a hypertext system?
 * Embed Curv graphics in hypertext, obviously. Interactive Curv documentation.
 * Use hypertext to structure code. How?
 * Use Curv as the programming language for a malleable hypertext system.

What are the core elements of Roam? What is the data model?
  https://nesslabs.com/roam-research
It's a wiki/outliner hybrid. You have a set of pages, each with a title & body.
The body is an textual outline (like Workflowy).
There is markup like $$math$$, [url], ![image-url].
There are wiki-style links, like [[Page Title]]. Special features:
 * Automatic display of backlinks. At the bottom, each page has a list of its
   backlinks. This even works for pages that haven't been given content yet,
   that exist only by virtue of having links that reference them.
 * A graph view that shows each page as a node, and its links as arcs.
 * Page and block(subpage) transclusion.
 * fuzzy tag search?
 * tags like #foo, apparently.
 * global auto update of wikilinks on rename
 * export as markdown (in one big file ala WorkFlowy)
 * Sidebar: If you Shift-Click on a tag or title you can open that page in the
   right-sidebar. You can also left-click on a bullet point to open that in the
   sidebar as well. The sidebar can be helpful for looking at multiple things
   at once, rather than jumping between documents

Integrating hypertext with Curv
-------------------------------
A wiki is a program. A [[foo]] link is a kind of variable reference.
A transclusion link means: interpolate the value of this expression.
