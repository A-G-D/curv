"Adding Interactive Visual Syntax to Textual Code" OOPSLA Nov 2020
https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/oopsla20-abf.pdf

Text is the primary representation of source code, but it is extended with
interactive visual diagrams to comment on and illustrate the code. This
is *not* the same as node based visual programming, since the diagrams are
problem specific.

Text and visual syntax may be arbitrarily composed.
