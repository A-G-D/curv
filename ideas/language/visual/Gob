A Gob is a graphical object. It lives on the screen, it occupies pixels, maybe
it can change, maybe you can interact with it. There is a Gob hierarchy:
some gobs are containers for other Gobs. Characters in a text document are
Gobs, and so on up. Glamorous Toolkit might be a model for the Gob hierarchy.

Gobs are expressions in a programming language. When you modify state,
you are editing code.
