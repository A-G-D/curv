It would be interesting if lenses were functions;
if every tree transformation function that could be a lens, is a lens;
if every combinator that can work on lenses, does work on lenses.

That way, we'd avoid duplication: having lens and function versions of
a bunch of abstractions. And we would have a richer supply of lenses.
