Optics: access and update of data structure elements
====================================================
A Curv data structure is a tree where the interior nodes are lists, records,
and possibly dictionaries and sets.

I want operations for indexing into a tree: select a field from a record,
select the i'th element of a list. I want array slices, to support vector
swizzling in GLSL. I want indexing abstraction: to select colour space
coordinates from a Colour, for an arbitrary colour space. And I want locatives
for updating data structures using an assignment statement.

Lenses support modularity and composability by providing an abstraction
by which a module can query and update a data structure without knowing
anything about the data structure. Lenses will be useful for defining
composable, hierarchical interactive animations in a pure functional style,
without using shared mutable state and event callback functions that mutate
state. They provide a way for UI logic (a widget, or a view and a controller)
to query and access a model.

I've experienced a lot of design churn, trying to define these indexing
operations. I don't know which design is best.

To clarify the problems, I am going to separate out the semantics from the
syntax. First I'll design a clear, powerful and composable semantic model,
without worrying about syntax. Then I'll consider syntax proposals in the
light of this semantic model.

It turns out that most array languages and imperative languages do not have a
composable algebra underlying their locative expressions. It's quite a bit of
work to derive such an algebra, expose it to the user, and implement it.

The Lens Abstraction
--------------------
A Lens (L) is a value for accessing or updating a subset of a tree.
In this section, I will describe only the abstract properties of lenses.
Implementation details and a convenient syntax will come later.

A Collection (C) is a mapping from Key values (K) onto Element values.
A collection is indexed by a key value.
A list L is indexed using a natural number: 0 <= key < count L.
A record R is indexed using a Symbol, naming a field of R.
A Dictionary is indexed using an arbitrary value.

A Tree (T) is recursively defined as either an arbitrarily element value E,
or as a collection of trees. Any node in a Tree is also an Element.
Interior nodes are lists, records and dictionaries.
 * In the general case, a Tree is an arbitrary value. It need not contain a
   collection. The identity lens, named `path[]`, maps an arbitrary value
   onto itself, just like the identity function. `get(path[])X == X` for all X.

get L T
    Retrieve one or more elements of the tree T.
    If it's a single element, just return it.
    If it's multiple elements, return a tree of elements.

put L Elems T
    Return a copy of T in which the elements of T indexed by L
    have been replaced by Elems.

over L F T
    Return a copy of T in which each E of T indexed by L
    have been replaced by F E.

Note: When the features of other programming languages are interpreted in terms
of the Lens abstraction, it is common to restrict the set of lenses that can be
used with updates (put and over) relative to queries (get). For example, in
GLSL vector swizzles, duplicate indices are allowed for read but not for write.

Each Lens has a shape.
A simple Lens accesses a single element E.
A compound Lens can access multiple elements, and returns these as a tree.
The structure of the result tree is the shape of the Lens.

at K
    This constructs a simple Lens for accessing a single element from
    a collection, indexed by the key value K.
    For example, `get (at 0) [3,4,5]` returns element 0 of the list, which is 3.

path [L1,L2,L3,...]
    This is the Lens composition operator.
    `get (path[L1,L2,L3]) C` means `C >> get L1 >> get L2 >> get L3`.
    `path[]` is the identity Lens: `get (path[]) T` is just T.
    `path` is an associative binary operator, such that
    path[L1,path[L2,L3]] == path[path[L1,L2],L3]` == path[L1,L2,L3].
    `path` is a monoid: it is an associative binary operator `path[L1,L2]`
    whose identity element is `path[]`.
    A path is simple if it is empty, or all of its element lenses are simple.

pick C
    pick maps a collection of lenses C onto a compound lens that applies
    each element of C to the same tree, and gathers all the results into
    a collection of elements with the same shape as C. For example,
     * [3,4,5] >> get(pick[at 0,at 1]) => [3,4]
     * [3,4,5] >> get(pick{a:at 0,b:at 1}) => {a:3,b:4}

    A pick constructs a compound lens. A nested pick constructs a nested lens
    with a deeper shape.
     * If C is a list, then this is standard vector swizzling,
       needed for SubCurv and GLSL. It's a standard part of K indexing.
     * If C is a record, then it's like enhanced indexing in K9.

    `pick` requires C to be ordered. All collections are ordered now.
    The problem is: a pick may contain duplicate key values. This
    complicates updates, because the same element may be updated multiple
    times with different values. To handle this case, we have to define
    the order of updates for a pick. The pick is traversed depth first,
    left to right (K9 semantics). So the collection must be ordered.

    Record picks seem useful as a way to extract fields from a tuple and
    present them as a record; or, to extract fields from a record and present
    them as another record with different field names.

just KeyList
    Map a record or dict onto a copy containing only the specified key values.
    The KeyList should have no duplicates, to ensure that duplicate updates
    do not occur (see `pick`). If we have a 'Set' data type, this should
    accept a Set argument.

slice [L1,L2,L3,...]
    This is a cross-product of lenses.
    If all of the lenses L1,L2,L3 are simple, then it's the same as path.

    If the tree being indexed is a rectangular array (represented by nested
    lists), then a slice of vector swizzles can represent traditional APL
    array slicing: extract a rectangular subarray. This is part of every
    linear algebra language. I don't need this now, but I might later when
    I learn more linear algebra.

    In the more general case of indexing a tree of lists using a slice of
    vector swizzles, this is equivalent to K indexing.

    Not the same as string slicing. put(slice X) will not allow you
    to change the number of elements in an array.

Abstract data types can provide lenses for indexing into ADT instances.

Lens as a Function
------------------
In order to create a good syntax for lenses, we may wish to treat lens
values as functions, so that `get L T` is written as `L T`.
This has some possible benefits.

A Lens S can be passed as an argument to `map` and other general
purpose combinators, without the need to `get L`. This is more
convenient, perhaps.

Lens combinators are also function combinators, which is parsimonious
and powerful.
 * Lens composition is function composition.
 * `swizzle [L1,L2]` becomes a function combinator equivalent to
   the Atlas in Q'Nial, or the constructor functional in FP/FL (called `cons`).

A colour space lens like sRGB would need to be repackaged
as `sRGB.from` (since sRGB is already a function).

Lens Representation
-------------------
What is the low-level API for user defined lens types?
Eg, this would be used to define colour space lenses.

How are Lens values represented in Curv? As records, I guess?

I considered defining a Lens to be a record containing #get and #put
functions, but I don't think that covers the full range of Lens semantics.
In Haskell:
    data Lens tree item
      = Lens { get :: tree -> item
             , put :: item -> tree -> tree
             }

Syntax: Bang-Index
------------------
A convenient backwards compatible syntax with full Lens semantics.
Rename Lens to Index. Tentatively, Index = Record{get: Function, set: Function}

Index application:
    tree!index        a locative
    put index newval tree
    over index mapping tree
Explicit index value constructors:
    at(key) -- works on lists, records, dicts
    path[ix1,ix2,ix3] index composition and explicit conversion
        S!i!j <=> S!path[i,j]
    pick[ix1,ix2,...] -- maps T to [T!ix1,T!ix2,...]
    pick{a:ix1,b:ix2,...} -- map T to {a:T!ix1,b:T!ix2,...}
    just(key_list) -- map a dict or record to a copy with only those keys
    slice(index_list) cross-product indexing
    `..` all elements of a list, record, dict, same as 'path[]'
    `last`: reactive nat, for constructing a list pick like 1..last
Backwards compatible syntax:
    record.fieldname    same as record!#fieldname
    list[ix]            same as list!ix
    list[ix1,ix2,ix3]   same as list!slice[ix1,ix2,ix3]
Terse indexing: implicit conversion to index values
    #foo is at(#foo): record!#foo <=> record.foo
    A nat, 0 is at(0): list!0 <=> list[0]
    A list L of indices is pick(L): vec![X,Y] <=> vec[[X,Y]]

Note: A record R of indices does not abbreviate pick(R) because Index
values are records.

Note: Index values are not functions because it conflicts with x![i,j]
as an abbreviation of x!pick[i,j] -- lists are already functions.
If Index <: Function, then it would violate Reynold's Law to have an implicit
conversion from [i,j] to pick[i,j].

Note: Other backward-compatible syntax considered for generalized indexing:
  a@ix  a.[ix]

The ! operator binds looser than postfix to support R!just[#foo] etc,
and is left-associative. The ! operator is used when you want to abstract
over an index expression, and the existing shortcuts don't suffice.
So you probably want a postfix expression as right argument in many cases.
 * Probably this eliminates more parentheses than the alternative, which is
   to give `!` and `.` the same precedence. Otherwise we write R!(just[#foo]).
 * No need to apply `.foo` to the end of a ! expr, just use !#foo.
 * Little need to apply an argument to the end of a ! expr,
   so (a!i!j) arg should be okay.
The ! operator binds tighter than arithmetic operators so that
    vec!X + vec![Y,Z]
can be used for array indexing of arithmetic terms.

Bang-Index Implementation
-------------------------
Rewrite `a.foo` as `a!#foo`.
Rewrite `a(ix)` as `a!list_slice(ix)`.
    list_slice is a specialized version of slice only used for this rewrite.
Rewrite `a!ix1!ix2!ix3` as `a!path[ix1,ix2,ix3]`.
Rewrite `a!ix := b` as `a := put ix b a`.

Consider:
    `a!ix := b` => `a := put ix b a`
I want data structure update (using assignment) to use COW. The compiler sees
that `a` is being assigned in `a := x`. If there is a single reference
to `a` in `x`, then we can MOVE the value of `a` into the corresponding
parameter slot (without changing the Value's use_count).
