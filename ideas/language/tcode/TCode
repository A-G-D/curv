T-Code
======
This is a radical redesign of the Curv virtual machine.
Curv is a term rewrite engine. All code and all data is, at the virtual
machine level, made out of "terms", aka a hierarchical data structure
called T-Code.
 * Data values are made out of T-Code.
 * Function values are made out of T-Code.
 * Source code is made out of T-Code. It is a hierarchical data structure,
   not linear text. The goal is to edit Curv source using a projectional
   editor. We will continue to support text files as a secondary representation
   of Curv programs. However, when a *.curv file is read and converted to
   T-Code by a projectional editor, newlines and indentation are discarded.
   Newlines and indentation are added back when converting T-Code to text,
   using an automatic program formatter.

What is T-Code?
