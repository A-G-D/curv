Pure Branded Values (ignoring types and data abstraction)
=========================================================
This is a useful standalone feature, which is also a prerequisite
for Algebraic Data Abstraction. ADA is too big to design at once.
So implement this first, design ADA later.

A branded value has a brand, which has the form of a constructor
expression. When evaluated in an appropriate environment, the brand
reconstructs the original value. Branded values are printed as their brands.
Equality depends on the brand (two brands can't be equal unless their brands
are equal). Brands are used for pattern matching.

A brand is:
  <brand> ::= <identifier>              -- name brand
            | <brand> <argvalue>        -- call brand
            | <brand> . <identifier>    -- field brand

A branded value is an atom, a function, or a module.
An atom is much like a symbol, in that the brand consistutes the entire
identity of the value.

A branded value abstractly consists of a brand and a payload.
The payload for an atom is the unit value. Otherwise the payload is an
anonymous function or module.

Referential transparency. The mechanisms for constructing branded values
do not violate referential transparency.

There is an equivalence relation, x === y.
In general x===y means substitutional equivalence: that x can be substituted
for y in any context without changing the meaning of the program. For branded
values, x===y is true if the brand and the payload are equivalent. For POD data,
equivalence is equality, except that 0 and -0 are not equivalent. For functions,
equivalence means same parse tree, and nonlocal bindings are equivalent.

Construction
------------
Syntax for defining branded values.
 1. Implicit. Certain types of values are in want of a name. They are born
    anonymous: if then bound to a name, they automatically acquire that name.
    Like Curv 0.4 functions and like struct types in Zig.
 2. Explicit. You use explicit syntax to bind a name, overriding a previous
    name: 'def name = bexpr'. The problem with functions in Curv 0.4 is that
    automatic naming only works at compile time for function literals, and
    the result of calling a function combinator doesn't acquire a name. A
    combinator result probably already has a name, and we want to rename it.

Top-down vs bottom-up name assignment.
 * If names are assigned bottom up, then the same module might be renamed
   multiple times. Assigning a name to a module requires evaluating the
   module expression, so modules need a construction thunk as part of their
   metadata, and we potentially need to evaluate it multiple times.
    * I considered a restricted form of module value, which is an unevaluated
      module: you can bind a name to it, but the dot operator isn't supported.
      But this hack doesn't support renaming a module returned by a combinator.
 * Perhaps names are assigned top down. A branded definiens phrase is evaluated
   in a context where the name is available in a VM register. The right side
   of a branded definition, or the body of a constructor function, is perhaps
   restricted to certain phrase types: a function literal, a module literal,
   and a function call (where the function should be a constructor).
    * So branded values get their brand during construction from a function
      or module literal; it can't be changed later.
    * This restriction handles my main use cases, but it interferes with
      abstracting a constructor call into a variable definition.
      The workaround is to abstract into a function with a [] argument.
    * This is also not compatible with patterned branded definitions
      like the proposed '[a, def b] = bexpr', which assumes bottom-up
      evaluation with renaming at each level where a name is available.

Top-Down/Explicit Construction
------------------------------
Right now, I like the explicit/top-down model. Module/function expressions
whose result doesn't receive a name from being invoked in the right context,
are still useable; they are just anonymous. The restrictions on how names
are bestowed could be loosened in the future?

To reiterate, brands are applied to functions and records only during
construction, not after the value already exists. In 'def x = <bphrase>',
the bphrase is a record lit, func lit, or funcall to a constructor function.
The latter must fail if the function position isn't a constructor, because
otherwise the requirement that an existing value can't be rebranded isn't met.

An anonymous constructor literal needs to be legal outside a bexpr context
because we use these for Curried functions. So it returns a function (ACF).

Semantics of anonymous constructor functions (ACFs)?
* What happens with 'def x = ACF arg'? Is x a branded value?
  I'd like to say yes, it is branded with 'x'.
  Therefore, the constructor nature is preserved, even though the ACF
  is anonymous.
* What happens with 'ACF arg' outside of a bexpr context?
  * Probably it's just a regular function call with no brand applied.
    Good enough for MVP.
  * Otherwise we need to extend the definition of what a brand is, so that
    an ACF can appear as the head of a call brand. (Is there a connection
    with parametric shape values in Curv next?)
* How is an ACF printed? As a constructor function literal.

Is an anonymous module literal legal outside of a bexpr context?
The best answer is yes.

Semantics of anonymous modules (AMs)? It's a record with module metadata.
* What happens with branded field definitions like 'def BF = bexpr'?
  * Is AM.BF branded with BF?
    Yes. It's analogous to typing 'def X = bexpr' in the REPL:
    the value of X is branded with X.
  * What about BF's docstring? Does AM.BF have that docstring?
    Yes.
* What happens with field docstrings in general? Are they preserved in the
  AM's metadata, and printed when the AM is printed? Yes.
* How is an AM printed? It's just a record with metadata. Each field has
  an independent value. So, {a: 1, BF: BF, c: 3}, plus field docstrings.

Can I construct a branded module using metaprogramming (dynamic record
literals)? This seems useful. Need field docstrings and branded fields.

Functions and Modules should be Rebrandable
-------------------------------------------
The inability to relabel a function (eg, def f = id) is alarming.

Just as `tpath[]` returns the labelled value `this`,
I would like `compose[]` to return the labelled value `id`, for clarity.
I can get this behaviour trivially by defining `compose` as:
    compose = reduce [id, [f,g] -> x -> x >> f >> g]

A function combinator C ought to be able to return a labelled function
as a result without breaking code like `def f = C x`.

Here's another one. Suppose we have 'def F = C x y z' (a branded function F).
If the function result is constructed by the body of 'C x y' then it works.
If the function result is computed by 'C x', which is captured in the closure
'C x y', then it fails, because an existing function value is relabelled.

There's no technical problem with relabelling a function.
However, there is a technical problem with relabelling a module,
and it's because of field labels, and the cost of relabelling values
in a module with new field labels. My best idea to address this problem
is for modules with branded fields to carry around a thunk for reconstructing
the module with a new brand. The top-down/explict proposal avoids this.

Alternatives:
* Functions can be rebranded (but not modules).
* Eliminate field brands. Modules are easily relabelled.
* Modules with branded fields carry a thunk, which reevaluates the module
  when it is rebranded.

Functions and modules should be rebrandable. Use thunks in modules with
branded fields. Use top-down branding to increase performance by avoiding
rebranding in the common cases.

Modules vs Records
------------------
Are modules distinct from records?
Should there be a distinct syntax for module literals?
 * Modules are API values, records are data.
 * A record is a model of:
   * A map from symbols to values, where all of the entries in the map
     have the same status. There are no relationships or dependencies
     between record fields.
   * A set of name/value pairs, that conform to a record type or schema.
     The value restrictions on fields, and the invariants that relate fields,
     are maintained by the code that constructs and updates the records.
 * A record can be updated: 'r.[#foo] := 42'.
 * Curv has both record and module types.
 * Module members can have doc strings.
 * Module members can be branded.
 * Modules can be branded.
 * A module 'call' member causes it to behave like a function.
 * The names in a module form a lexical scope, with dependencies between
   module members created by references. If we allow modules to be rebranded,
   then these dependencies are preserved in the module value.
 * Every value can be serialized, transmitted across the internet, then
   reconstituted with no change in identity, behaviour or performance.
   For modules, this effectively requires transmitting the source code.
   (For javascript, this is accomplished by transmitting textual source code;
   for java, it's jar files.) So the printed version of a module should display
   source code (a scoped module literal), similar to the printed version of a
   function?

{a=1} is a module, {a:1} is a record, {} is an empty module or record.
They print differently, as a module or record literal.
Modules retain their construction code, needed for printing & rebranding.

Is there a subtype relation between modules and records?
Technically, no, because {a=1} prints differently than {a:1}.
So this is not the same as the integers being a coherent subset of the numbers
with special properties. Also, in Curv there are no subtype relationships
between data types, there are only subtheory relationships between theories.
In [[Theories]] I say that for chimeric API values to exist, there needs to be
a Record *theory*, which curv::DRecord and curv::Module implement.
Also, a callable module is one that implements the Function or Callable theory.
For those specific modules, we want 'is Callable M' to be true. But it's false
for modules that don't implement 'call'.

So either an algebra that implements a theory can specify, via a predicate,
which of its values implements that theory. Or, not all modules belong to
the same data type. The ones that implement Callable belong to different data
types from the ones that don't.

A record can be used in any context requiring a module:
* A record is like a module with no docstrings or branded members,
  and no dependencies between fields.
* Except: treatment of call field?
* Except: a record is serialized differently from the equivalent module.
* Except: equality of a record and equivalent module?
Record field update doesn't make sense for modules. Updating a module member
should update any member that depends on its value.

Constructor Function Docstrings
-------------------------------
What is the deal with
    <docstring1> def f x = <docstring2> branded {foo: x}
The help for 'f' is <docstring1>.
The help for 'f 42' is <docstring2>.
This just falls out of the grammar, but what are the use cases?
Won't there be a lot of duplication between <docstring1> and <docstring2>?

Note: in the case of a branded module, it does make sense to separate the
documentation for the module as a whole from the documentation for
individual members.

Note: in the case of a branded constructor (functor?), I'm not familiar
with software systems that separate the documention for a functor from
the documentation for a functor instance.
* Don't worry about this extra possibility in the grammar? Just
  don't provide functor instance documentation if it doesn't make sense.
* It might make sense for a piecewise functor. The functor instance has
  different documentation for each branded alternative. This story would
  improve if the docs for each branded alternative can be included in
  the main functor doc automatically, similar to what happens for
  module documentation. But, the grammar doesn't let me attach docstrings
  to the branches of a 'match' call, and I don't have a design for this at all.

For MVP, there's no docstring in the body of a constructor.
Leave this as a future enhancement.

What about a piecewise functor? With classless oop,
    def cube = match [
        d::Num -> cube {d:d},
        {d::Num} -> branded box[d,d,d]
    ]

Let's suppose that 'cube' is not a prototypical cube, it is instead a
module that presents a cube construction API. For an actual cube,
use 'cube 10'. What help do I get for 'help cube' and 'help (cube 10)'?

Syntax
------
As a simplification, I'll say that the unit value is `{}`.
This unifies atoms with modules, reducing the amount of primitive syntax.

Terminology: branded value, brand, branded definition

A branded definition is:
    def <id> = <bexpr>
where <bexpr> computes a module or function. This can be preceeded by a
docstring, which becomes part of the metadata of a branded value.
This is legal anywhere a definition is legal, including a let phrase,
and a REPL command.

A *.curv source file in a directory record yields a branded definition
if the contents of the source file are:
    <explicit-bexpr>
optionally preceded by a docstring. An explicit-bexpr is
    branded <bexpr>
The 'branded' keyword can be omitted if <bexpr> is a function literal
or a non-empty module literal.

An anonymous module literal is what used to be called a scoped record literal.
It may contain branded definitions. Any definition can be preceded by a
docstring.

An anonymous constructor function is constructed using
    <param> -> <explict-bexpr>
Calling an anonymous constructor function is the same as calling a regular
function. The behaviour is different when you print the function, and when
you bind it using a branded definition.
You can construct anonymous constructor functions using combinators.

Opaque Syntax
-------------
Terminology: opaque value, label, opaque definition

Opaque definition:
    <docstring> def <id> = <api-expr>
where <api-expr> denotes a function or module,
and <docstring> is an optional documentation comment.

Opaque expr: '<docstring> opaque <api-expr>'.
An opaque expression is recognized at compile time. The 'opaque' keyword may
be omitted if <api-expr> is a function literal or a non-empty module literal.

An opaque expression denotes a value that is available to receive a label.
It is legal in these contexts:
 * As the top level expression in a *.curv file.
   Receives a label if the source file is a member of a directory module.
 * As the body of a function. The function is marked at compile time
   as a constructor function. Receives a label if the constructor function
   is bound to a label using an opaque definition, and the opaque constructor
   function is then called with an argument.
 * Following the principles of general phrase abstraction, should we also
   support these contexts?
     ( <opaque-expr> )
     let <definitions> in <opaque-expr>
   In these cases, where is the best place to put the 'opaque' keyword
   and the <docstring>? This is a bit silly; we already have full phrase
   abstraction inside the <api-expr>, and the only outcome of this digression
   is whether to have more flexibility in the placement of the <docstring>
   and the 'opaque' keyword.

I think 'branded' is better than 'opaque'.

Primitive Syntax
----------------
The minimum syntax needed to make this work. I'm not worrying about
ergonomics, just simplicity and orthogonality.

As an initial simplification, I'll say that the unit value is `{}`.
This unifies atoms with modules, reducing the amount of primitive syntax.

A branded definition is:
    branded <id> = <bexpr>
where <bexpr> computes a record, anonymous module, function, or anonymous 
constructor function. This can be preceeded by a docstring, which becomes
part of the metadata of a branded value.

At the top level of a *.curv source file in a directory record:
    branded <bexpr>

An anonymous module is constructed using a scoped record literal that
contains docstrings and/or branded definitions. You can't extract fields
from an anonymous module, it must be branded first. But you can construct
anonymous modules using combinators.

An anonymous constructor function is constructed using
    <param> -> branded <bexpr>
Calling an anonymous constructor function is the same as calling a regular
function. The behaviour is different when you print the function, and when
you bind it using a branded definition.
You can construct anonymous constructor functions using combinators.

Ergonomic Syntax
----------------
Some additional syntax to make this feature easier to use in the context
of modular programming. Not worrying about data abstraction here.

Alternate keyword choices:
* abstract:
* labelled:
* branded:
* opaque: An opaque value is printed as a label, hiding its representation.
  A constructor function returns an opaque value if the function itself
  is made opaque.
        def foo = x -> opaque <func-or-module-expression>
* 'named', 5 letters.
* 'term'. Use 'term' to mean 'branded value'. An 'anonymous term'
  is an anonymous module or an anonymous constructor function.
* 'def' works well at the head of a definition, is familiar from Python, Lisp
  and other languages, but looks weird in the context of 'def <bexpr>'.
  (It could be considered an abbreviation of 'definiendum'.)
* 'nom', as an abbreviation of 'nominal'.
  Use 'nominal value' to mean 'branded value'.
* 'api', because branded values are restricted to "API values".
  Not true if you consider data constructors.

What it looks like:
    branded f = x y z -> stuff
    branded f = x -> branded y -> branded z -> stuff

    named f = x y z -> stuff
    named f = x -> named y -> named z -> stuff

    term f = x y z -> stuff
    term f = x -> term y -> term z -> stuff

    def f = x y z -> stuff
    def f = x -> def y -> def z -> stuff
        -- NOPE: don't put 'def' before a function parameter name.
        -- Use a different keyword.

    api f = x y z -> stuff
    api f = x -> api y -> api z -> stuff

    nom f = x y z -> stuff
    nom f = x -> nom y -> nom z -> stuff

Alternative Syntax Schemas:
 1. Single keyword.
        branded f = x y z -> stuff
        branded f = x -> branded y -> branded z -> stuff
        branded f x y z = stuff
 2. Two keywords.
    'def' attaches to an identifier in a definiens, has high precedence.
    Pattern matching definitions are supported, eg '[x, def y] = bexpr'.
    'branded' attaches to a bexpr, has low precedence.
        def f = x y z -> stuff
        def f = x -> branded y -> branded z -> stuff
        def f x y z = stuff
    Both keywords may be preceded by a docstring.

Let's examine the 'two keywords' option.

Finalists for the first keyword:
    def lerp[a,b,t] = a*(1-t) + b*t;
    api lerp[a,b,t] = a*(1-t) + b*t;

The second keyword is a word that describes the argument 'bexpr', and limits
what 'bexpr' can evaluate to. It appears in two contexts:
    x -> branded y -> x + y  -- constructor function
    branded {...}            -- top level of a file in a directory record
This word is also used in documentation.
Keyword length is not an issue; 3-7 characters is okay.
Options:
 * 'labelled'
 * 'branded'
 * 'named'
 * 'term'. Use 'term' to mean 'branded value'. An 'anonymous term'
   is an anonymous module or an anonymous constructor function.
 * 'nom', as an abbreviation of 'nominal'.
   Use 'nominal value' to mean 'branded value'.
 * 'api', because branded values are restricted to "API values".

   x -> branded y -> x + y    branded {...}
   x -> named y -> x + y      named {...}
   x -> term y -> x + y       term {...}
   x -> nom y -> x + y        nom {...}
   x -> api y -> x + y        api {...}
Finalists:
   x -> branded y -> x + y    branded {...}
   x -> term y -> x + y       term {...}




Curried functions.
    term f x y z = stuff
    term f = x y z -> stuff
is the same as
    term f = x -> term y -> term z -> stuff

The function `x -> term y -> x + y`
is printed as `x y -> x + y`.
So the function literal syntax has changed since Curv 0.4.
