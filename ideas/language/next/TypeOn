Ontology of Type Related Entities
=================================
Informally, a type is a set of values, together with a set of common
operations supported by all of the values.

Carrier
-------
A **Carrier** is the value set of a type (also known as the underlying set,
carrier set, or domain). See also the "Type" concept in [[types/Types]].

A Carrier has an associated representation: given a description of the
values within a Carrier, we can sometimes compute a more efficient, or more
compact representation.

Carrier operations:
    is carrier value
        Predicate, true if value is a member of the carrier set.
    as carrier value
        Fail if value is not a member of the carrier set.
        Otherwise, return the argument. The argument may be converted to a
        more efficient internal representation, but even so, the result value
        compares equal to the argument value.

Constructor
-----------
All Curv values are printed as constructor expressions.

Constructor expressions may be used for pattern matching.

There are user-defined constructors.

It is cheap to test if a value has a specified named constructor.

In *some* cases, a Carrier will correspond exactly with the set of values
that share a constructor.
