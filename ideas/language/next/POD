POD: Plain Old Data
===================
Plain Old Data is a set of 6 general purpose data types that can be used
to describe any kind of data.

Inspiration for POD is drawn from multiple sources: Lisp S-Expressions,
JSON, the K programming language, and others.

Unlike other implementations of POD, Curv explicitly supports algebraic
data structures: both sums and products.

POD has 6 data types:
    scalar types: symbol, number, character
    collection types: arrow, list, record

A "product" data structure is a collection of values.
Lists, records and arrows are used to represent products.

Unlike JSON, there is no primitive "string" type. Instead,
there is a character type, and there are lists of characters.

A "sum" data structure is one of a set of named alternatives.
An "alternative" is either a label (a symbol value like `#foo`)
or it is a labeled value (an arrow value like `foo: 42`, aka `#foo => 42`).
