Actions
=======
An action value is an unevaluated generator or debug action.
Use cases:
 * Abstracting over generators or debug actions.
 * Defining a generator recursively.
 * Using `match` to define a generator.
 * Once I have an interactive debugger, and a rich set of actions for
   controlling the debugger, then user-defined actions are debugger scripts.
 * print, error, and warning become values.

Constructor:
    action <generator>
    action <statement>
An action body may contain recursive references.

To call an action in a statement or generator context, use:
    !<action>

Note that `!` is a generalization of (and replacement for) `exec`.
It's more general because `!a` is a generator.

`print` and `warning` become functions that return actions. So you write:
    !print "hello world"

This eliminates the confusion in previous versions of Curv, where you write
'print a' in a generator context, and it doesn't behave like a function call,
it doesn't produce a value. In mainstream languages, 'print' would be an
impure function that returns the unit value, and adding a call to 'print'
in the middle of a list constructor would add a value to the list.
The new syntax makes it clear that `!print msg` is not an ordinary function
call expression.

`error` becomes an ordinary function (no magic required). You can write:
    !error "oops"
in a statement or generator context, and it works because error does not return.

Predicate: `is_action`.

Semantics
---------
Actions are intended to be a generalized mechanism for causing effects.
For now, they can cause debug effects, and produce values in a generator.
Later, other effects may be supported.

Semantically, an action value is a linear function that maps an Executor
value (containing the state of an imperative computation) onto another
Executor value. This follows from the libcurv implementation of actions
(Operation::exec).

The syntax `!<action>` invokes this linear function to transform the current
state of an imperative execution context.

A generator action maps a List_Builder value onto another List_Builder value
(following libcurv). Record_Builder is a subtype of List_Builder.

A debug action is an identity function with side effects (the Executor value
may have any type, and is not interpreted). This makes debug actions maximally
composable: they can be inserted into any sequential execution sequence.
 * Insert into a pipeline: stuff >> print msg >> rest of pipeline
 * Insert into a list of functions to be composed: `compose[f,print "foo",g]`
 * Insert into a generator: [a, !print msg, b]
 * Insert into a variable transform chain: x!reverse!print "hello"!to_lower

Maybe we can implement actions as functions once the ADT mechanism is complete.

Discussion
----------
An action cannot capture a reference to a nonlocal mutable variable, so actions
are not a true abstraction over imperative statements. However, they are a true
abstraction over generators and debug effects. They are semantically equivalent
to unevaluated generators right now (but may become more general later).

Use procedures to abstract over mutable variable references in a statement.

Maybe it is better to have two syntaxes for executing an action:
    ! <pure-action>
    ... <general-action>
The '!' variant is for "pure" actions which have no effect, other than
debug effects. The implicit imperative state (eg for generators)
is not modified in the '!' case. The more verbose '...' operator allows
the action to modify the implicit imperative state, and tells the reader this
is happening. Rationale:
 * Comes from my general concern about: making inputs to functions explicit,
   and enabling you to understand data dependencies using local reasoning.
 * This helps in computing blame for a function call argument when only the
   argument syntax is available. When we are trying to identify the n-th
   element of a list in a list constructor phrase (syntax only), we know that
   '!a' cannot contribute any list elements. Humans can benefit from the same
   syntactic reasoning.
 * This is related to a discussion in [[Proc]] about generator procedures,
   where this line of thought is extended to 'pure' procedures (which are
   pure functions) and 'pure' variable updates (which only modify the variable,
   not the imperative state).

What if I need a function-like abstraction that both returns a value, and
produces values like a generator? Functions in Curv do not have side effects.
However,
* My function can return an action along with another value. So I call the
  function, destructure the result, then invoke the resulting action.
* If there are generator procedures, use them. See [[Proc]].
