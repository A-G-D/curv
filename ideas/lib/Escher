The exponential map shows up in Escher's "print gallery" too,
which I tried to explain here:
    http://roy.red/droste-.html
And you can use it to make various interesting things:

I like this paper that extends the Mercator projection of the earth down
a few inches so you can see what it does down right next to the South Pole:

The article mentions a lot of interesting properties of the complex exponential
map. I find it especially neat that horizontal and vertical translation map
to uniform scaling and rotation. A mapping that shuffles transformations
around like that can be used in creative ways.

I'd like to add another interesting property, that naturally stems from the
above: the mapping transforms regularly repeating shapes into self-similar
shapes. Any geometry that repeats along the x axis (with a given period
P) will be mapped to a geometry that is self-similar under scaling by the
same value P. You can create mappings in more dimensions that have the same
properties, for example in 3 dimensions:

Check out the animations in this slide show. I'd like to program these in Curv:
