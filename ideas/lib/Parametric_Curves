We show how to compute a strip tree representation for a general parametric
curve, using affine arithmetic2 to find good bounding rectangles. Then
we show how to compute approximate distance fields for parametric curves.

A strip tree is a chain of bounding rectangles that enclose and approximate
a curve.

Strip trees were introduced by Ballard as a multi-resolution data structure for
representing polygonal curves. The main concept in strip trees is to represent
each piece of the curve by a bounding rectangle that contains the piece. When
this is done in a hierarchical fashion —starting from the whole curve,
subdividing the curve at suitable points, and going down to individual edges
—we get a tree of rectangles, each rectangle containing a piece of the curve.

Ballard described how the multi-resolution representation provided by strip
trees can be used to solve several practical problems efficiently, including
displaying a curve at a given resolution, intersecting two curves, computing
the length of a curve at a given resolution, testing the proximity of a point
to a curve, and testing whether a point is inside a region bounded by a curve.
