// "geode" is the French word for "geodesic sphere".

// OpenJSCad has one.

I've created a gist, https://gist.github.com/Yona-Appletree/a03bc32a5c5ca6886e38 with my implementation of geodesic slicing. The geodesic_example.scad file contains an example of using the library. You'll have to excuse the quality of the code... I was just learning OpenSCAD and geodesic math at the time, so it's kind of funky, but it does work correctly, as far as I know.

// GeodesicSphere is a simple parametric polyhedron.
// There is a separate WireFrame operator that converts a polyhedron
