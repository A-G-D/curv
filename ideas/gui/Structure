The Curv GUI / IDE
==================
There are 3 important windows or panes: Console, Editor, Viewer.

One idea is to bond all 3 panes into a single window, similar to Processing,
OpenSCAD, LibFive.

Another idea is to leave these as separate windows, like Python's Idle.
* Idle always has a single Console window, plus zero or more Editor windows.
* DrRacket bonds a console & editor pane together. The interactive shell in
  the console has access to the top level scope of the program being edited.
  * Idle has a similar feature, but the console has access to the top level
    scope of the most recent program to be executed. Not very intuitive.
* I can imagine using several Viewer windows while working
  on a single program.

Stuff to look at:
* the Factor IDE
* XCode Swift Playgrounds. Well, the UI is very bare, it's not that obvious
  what to do.

Making it obvious: when you start gcurv, it opens a 3 pane window with editor,
console and viewer panes. The editor is initialized with the program `cube`,
and a cube is displayed in the viewer.

Remember window size/layout between runs.

Other window types/features:
* Package manager
* Package editor (& node browser)
  * Git integration?
* Documentation browser
* J has interactive tutorials which run in the console window.
  Maybe the package editor has a 'slide show' feature for viewing
  a sequence of programs.
* Debugging.
  * Brett Victor's ideas for visualizing the execution of a program.

Console
-------
The Console serves 2 roles: it displays log output (error messages,
output from `print` actions). And it is an interactive shell.

* Copy and paste should work using standard shortcuts.
* Access command history using uparrow or ^P.
* Use colours and fonts to distinguish between input and output.
* Use those squiggly red underlines to highlight program text in error messages.

Python Idle3 console:
* colours: prompt red, output blue, colourized program text
* type 'print(' and a yellow tooltip appears just below the line being typed
  containing
      print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
  and this disappears when I type the closing ) of the function call.

Python and J both use a single console window that doubles as both a shell
window (for interactive input/output) and also as a log window for all
editor/program windows (error messages and print statement output).

Editor
------
Python and J both have editor windows where you can type a multi-line program,
and the storage is associated with a file in the file system.
Initially none are open, you can open multiple.

Viewer
------
The beginner-friendly Processing window layout has a single viewer bonded
to an editor and console.

I can imagine using several Viewer windows while working on a single program.
* In the console shell, you can view a shape, and it will open a secondary
  viewer.
* Maybe there's something like an OpenSCAD 'modifier character', a way to
  annotate a subexpression and display its value in a viewer.
