How to interoperate between WASM and Javascript. You need some way to
translate WASM objects to Javascript objects, and vice versa.
A framework is needed for this:
 * Rust: https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/
 * C++/Emscripten:
   https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html
 * Cheerp has one as well.
