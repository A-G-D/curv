WASM can be used for:
* Running the Curv IDE in a web browser.
* Compiling Curv code to WASM for faster execution (than interpreter),
  eg for mesh export. Firefox will use Cranelift for WASM code gen, which
  prioritizes code gen speed over optimization. I won't get LLVM performance
  in a web browser. Native Curv will always win.
* Sandboxed, platform independent binaries.
  * Distribution format for compiled Curv binaries and plugins?
  * Distribution format for the Curv program?

In the future, could I JIT compile Curv programs into WASM and then run them
as efficiently as native code? I would need LLVM quality code generation,
a vectorized implementation of the GLM and/or Eigen library APIs,
and multi-threaded data parallelism primitives. WASM needs SIMD and threads.
I'll need an LLVM based WASM to native JIT compiler.

Emscripten : compile C++ to WASM
Cheerp : Emscripten competitor
Rust : easy generation of WASM code, wasm-bindgen
LLVM/Clang 8 : has a WASM target. Rust moved from Emscripten to LLVM for WASM.
Wasmer : Run WASM outside browser (github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)
WebIDL : High level type system for interoperation between WASM modules and:
         other WASM modules, Javascript, native code, etc.
         https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types
WASI : Portable operating system API for WASM modules: Posix, WebGPU, and more.
Bytecode Alliance .org:
 * Wasmtime : standalone WASM runtime.
 * Cranelift : WASM -> portable SSA IR -> native code; fast code generator.
 * WASI common : standalone implementation of WASI.
inNative : C library for compiling WASM to C compatible binary: DLL or EXE.

How to interoperate between WASM and Javascript. You need some way to
translate WASM objects to Javascript objects, and vice versa.
A framework is needed for this:
 * Rust: https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/
 * C++/Emscripten:
   https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html
 * Cheerp has one as well.

inNative is an AOT compiler for WASM that creates C compatible binaries,
either as sandboxed plugins you can dynamically load, or as stand-alone
executables that interface directly with the operating system. This allows
webassembly modules to participate in C linking and the build process, either
statically, dynamically, or with access to the host operating system. The
runtime can be installed standalone on a userâ€™s machine, or it can be
embedded inside your program.
 * open source Apache 2.0 https://github.com/innative-sdk/innative
 * uses a fork of LLVM 9.x stable
