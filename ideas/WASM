WASM can be used for:
* running Curv programs in a web browser
* sandboxed, platform independent binaries
  * distribution format for compiled Curv binaries and plugins?
  * distribution format for the Curv program?

Emscripten : compile C++ to WASM
Cheerp : Emscripten competitor
Rust : easy generation of WASM code, wasm-bindgen
LLVM/Clang 8 : has a WASM target. Rust moved from Emscripten to LLVM for WASM.
Wasmer : run WASM outside browser (github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)

How to interoperate between WASM and Javascript. You need some way to
translate WASM objects to Javascript objects, and vice versa.
A framework is needed for this:
 * Rust: https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/
 * C++/Emscripten:
   https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html
 * Cheerp has one as well.
