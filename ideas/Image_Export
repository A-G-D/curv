To start with, PNG export for finite 2D shapes.

curv -o foo.png smoke.curv
curv -o png smoke.curv >foo.png

What is the pixel size?
* default. Something reasonable for pasting in a web page. Larger dimension
  is 500 pixels.
* -O psize=pixel_size
* -O xsize=image_width
* -O ysize=image_height
* -O xsize=image_width -O ysize=image_height

If the shape is not a rectangle, how are the background pixels coloured?
* default is white
* transparent (alpha=0) is a nice option. But we don't support alpha on import.

Maybe a border option.

An anti-aliasing option would be nice.

API in curv::geom
-----------------
<libcurv/geom/export_image.h>

void export_png(Shape_Program, Output_File&, glm::ivec2)
* This uses the Viewer. Must run in main thread? That works for CLI batch mode.

Helper functions for converting CLI image export -O options to an image size:
    ivec2 image_size_default(Shape_Program)
    ivec2 image_size_from_psize(Shape_Program, double psize)
    ivec2 image_size_from_xsize(Shape_Program, unsigned xsize)
    ivec2 image_size_from_ysize(Shape_Program, unsigned xsize)

Technical debt:
---------------
* help for -O options
* error message for unrecognized -O option

* `curv -o foo.png smoke.curv`. `-o png` still works, writes to stdout.
  Pass pathname as an argument to an export function, instead of a stream.
  File is only created if export is successful. (A temp file is used in stdout
  case.)

* Graphics file export code is split between CLI interface (-O processing)
  and kernel code in libcurv/geom.
