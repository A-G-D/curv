Types of collaboration:

1. Publish your code. Other people (who you may not know) can discover your
code, reuse it, remix it.

Centralized version: github public repository. Decentralized version: IPFS,
plus a discovery mechanism.

2. Share your code with members of your team (but don't share it outside your
team).

Centralized version: github private repository. Less centralized version: Run
your own git server, with authentication and a user account for each team
member. Decentralized version: Each team member has their own git repository,
shares patches with other team members.

3. Real time collaboration. Several people editing the same code base at the
same time.

Centralized: The true version of the code exists on a central server.
Decentralized: Each person has their own copy of the code, and a peer to peer
protocol keeps them in sync.

4. Collaborative live coding. Several people editing the same code base while
the program is running. Or, in a video/music performance, outputs of one live
coding session are taken as inputs to another live coding session, in real time.
