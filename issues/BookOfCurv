 * Book of Shaders is a model for interactive documentation. To replicate it,
   I either need to run the Curv engine in a web browser, or I need a desktop
   client that runs Curv and also displays documentation. Or both?
    * Which is more difficult?
    * Which is more accessible?
    * Which is ultimately more powerful?
    * It would be cool to have a single UI that is an editor and viewer
      for interactive documentation and also a Curv IDE.
    * How do I implement this UI?
       * Maybe it requires a web browser, and the desktop UI is ultimately
         Electron based.
       * Maybe this UI uses Curv to render all UI elements. To run in a web
         browser, the UI program is compiled into WASM instead of native code.
       * What is the shortest path to using Curv to render 2D graphics
         efficiently for rendering interactive, mostly 2D rich text documents,
         with bits of embedded 3D?
