Create a separate sdf-to-poly repo.
It contains a C++ library for sampling an SDF function
and generating 2D and 3D polygonal/polyhedral file formats.
Multiple conversion algorithms and multiple file formats are supported.

Libfive is one of the supported algorithms.
I want 2D SVG output for doing craft projects.
