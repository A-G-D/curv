^C interrupts a running program in the REPL.

Proposed implementation:

  There is a 'bool interrupt' field in System.

  Before calling a function, and on each iteration of a for or while loop,
  we check system.interrupt and throw an interrupt exception if it is true.

  The exception carries a stack trace.
