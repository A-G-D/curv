Allow ',' to be used, instead of ';',
in any context where we are separating items in a collection.
 * Allow commas in scoped record constructors.
     {x=1, y=2}
 * Allow commas at the top level of a list or record comprehension,
   even with local defs.
     [local x=1, while (x>=0) (x; x:=x-1)]

Curv still has a problem answering the question "what's the difference between
a comma and a semicolon", but the above changes make things better, until I have
a final design.
