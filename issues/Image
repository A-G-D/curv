Image Values
============
Goals:
* construct an image (pixel array) algorithmically
* load an image from a file
* access the pixel elements directly
* access the pixel array using a sampler interface
* use an image as a 2D shape
* 'curv foo.png' displays the image
* Image picker that lets you load a PNG file?

Design:
An `Image` value contains a pixel array, implements the Shape protocol,
implements a sampler API.
* You can read the pixel array. Using index values, you can modify pixels,
  but not change their type, and you can't modify the array dimensions.

`file "foo.png"` loads the PNG file as an Image value.

SubCurv directly understands the Image type.
