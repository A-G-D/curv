parametric records
==================
* Parametric records are printed in accordance with the Printable proposal.
  The constructor and constructor argument are printed (not the fields).
  Use `...PR` to print the fields in the REPL.
* Fields cannot be updated using `PR.field := val` or `update #field val PR`.
  This reports an error, because the field is now out of sync with the
  constructor, and the record would be printed incorrectly.
* `PR.[param]`: `param` is a builtin lens for fetching and updating the
  constructor argument.
