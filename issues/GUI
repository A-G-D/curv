'gcurv' or 'curv -g' is a 3 pane live editor GUI, consisting of a text editing
pane, a console output pane, and a graphics pane.

Initially, this will just mimic the capabilities of 'curv -le', except using
a built-in editor rather than an external editor, and with the entire UI
running in a single window.

Later, we can leverage the integrated design and extend the GUI with new
features that aren't available in 'curv -le'.

Rationale:
 * The pandemic. I was unable to share a 'curv -le' session over jitsi,
   because screen sharing didn't work, even though sharing a single app
   window worked.
 * Ease of use. There is demand for an easy to install Windows version of
   Curv. The requirement is to minimize the time it takes to install Curv
   and start playing with it. A GUI will remove friction for casual users
   who just want to play with Curv a bit and see what it is all about.
 * A basis for a smoother and more integrated live editing experience.
