Ref: [[ideas/language/syntax/Comma]]

TODO (implement Theory 4):
 * () should work as a null statement in stmt context
 * 'id:expr' is an expression, sugar for [#id,expr]
   WAIT: Nominal types/modules design may change this.
 * 'expr1,expr2,expr3' should be a statement in statement context
 * (expr1,expr2,expr3) as a list in expr context is deprecated at level 1
 * Documentation updates, as per Theory 4 of Comma
