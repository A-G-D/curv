Booleans, Bits and Bitstrings
=============================

Requirements
------------
A 'bit' is a binary digit (0 or 1): the basic unit of computer storage.
A 'Boolean' is a truth value (true or false, sometimes written 0 or 1).
[From Wiktionary.] Mathworld says: "two-valued Boolean algebra (whose members
are most commonly denoted 0 and 1, or false and true)".
A 'bit string' is a list of bits. Wikipedia et al.

Boolean is an algebraic type, with patterns that match true and false.

The Boolean operations are not, and, or, xor, from Boolean algebra.
These operations apply equally to bits.

In mathematics, the Iverson bracket is a convention for converting boolean
expressions (eg, of relational operators) to bit values (0 and 1) and then
performing arithmetic on these bit values (eg, addition and multiplication)
in order to express mathematical ideas. These idioms also appear in APL and
subsequent array languages. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket

There are bit string operations like `bshift` and `bsum` which model hardware
operations, and are not Boolean operations. They are important in SubCurv.

From array languages and GLSL, we get operations on boolean strings.
Vectorized relational operators return boolean strings, which can be used
to select list elements.

In some contexts, we need a compact boolean/bit string representation,
with 1 bit per element.

Terse syntax for bit string literals. [#true,#true,#false,...] is too much.

Encoding
--------
How are Booleans, bits and bit strings encoded in Curv?

In the following ideas, bits are encoded the same as bools, and the conversion
to integer in #2 and #3 is only for Iverson bracket idioms.
1. True and false are encoded as 0 and 1, which are also bits. Like APL/K/C99.
2. True and false are distinct named values which may be explicitly converted
   to 1 and 0 using the `bit` function. Like Curv 0.4.
3. True and false are distinct named values that print as "true" and "false",
   but are coerced to 1 and 0 in arithmetic contexts. Like Python.
   * If the coercion is only for Iverson bracket, use #2 instead (simpler).
   * Perhaps 1 and 0 are coerced to Bool in boolean contexts. Why?

Or, bits are encoded as 0,1 and bools are encoded as #false,#true or false,true.
These are disjoint types.
* The boolean operations are overloaded over bits and bools.
  and[#true,#false]=>#false, and[1,0]=>0, and[#true,0] fails.
  * problem: and[] is undefined.
* Does bsum work on bool strings or only on bit strings?
* There are explicit conversions bool->bit and bit->bool.
* This design violates the Orthogonality and High Level Types principles.

The shortlist of viable encodings:
* Use 0 and 1.
* Use symbolic truth values.
  Provide bit & bool to convert between 0/1 and symbolic truth values.
  * Use #true and #false
  * Use true and false (named values)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A blist is a list of booleans.

Currently we have the following generic blist operations:
    bit blist => list of bits (integers in range 0..1)
    bool bitlist => blist          -- not implemented yet
    and[a,b]
    or[a,b]
    xor[a,b]
    lshift[a,n]
    rshift[a,n]
Plus these bool32 operators:
    bool32_sum
    bool32_product
    bool32_to_float  float_to_bool32
    bool32_to_nat    nat_to_bool32

Common Proposal (shared by Blist and Bitstring proposals):
 * Replace `lshift` and `rshift` with `bshift n b`.
   This needs support for curried functions in SubCurv.
 * Replace `bool32_sum` with `bsum`, it adds 1 or more blists of the same count.
 * Ditto for `bool32_product`, or remove it.
 * Implement a compact blist representation, one bit per element.

Blist Proposal:
 * implement 'bool'.
 * Add compact blist literals, eg `#1110`, which
   is equivalent to {#true,#true,#true,#false}.

Bitstrings: consider the Bits not Bools proposal.

Shift operators
---------------
    a `lshift` n
    a `rshift` n
isn't compatible with a blist pipeline. Consider instead:
    a >> lshift n
    a >> rshift n
or
    n `lshift` a
    n `rshift` a

It's also confusing that "right shift" moves the bits to the left,
when viewed in printed (little endian) order. Solution, use `bshift`
with an integer argument, where +n means << and -n means >>.
    a >> bshift n       bshift n a
    n `bshift` a        bshift [n,a]
When passing a partial application to a combinator:
    map (bshift n) a
    map (`bshift` n) a
I think the preferred style is curried, unless there are reasons to put the
two arguments into a pair (homogeneous values, associative binary operator).

The problem with bshift is that when compiling to GLSL or C++, if the
`n` argument is not a constant, then I need to emit a conditional expression
that dispatches to << or >> as n is >0 or <0. Mitigating factors:
* The `n` argument is normally constant.
* Add a `Nat` type to SubCurv.

Final design:
    bshift n

literals
--------
We could add special syntax for blist literals.
* K:       1110b
* SQL-99:  B'1110' or X'E'
* QNial:   lllo
* LDAP:    '1110'B
* Erlang:  Complicated expressions of <<...>>, aimed at describing
           bit and byte strings in binary file formats and protocols,
           which are split into fields. Also supports pattern matching.
* #:       #1110
           #0xEF00
  
I like the idea of supporting either binary or hex blist literals,
it matches the lib.random source. Using 'b' or 'x' to distinguish
them seems good. It's good if this *isn't* confused with a numeral.

    b"1110"  x"E"

Problems with hex literals:
* Hex notation is big endian. Hex bitstring literals copied from programs
  written in other languages are big-endian integer literals.
  The blist representation, as a list of booleans, is little endian.
  The low order bit is the first list element.
* The array-language blist literals (1110b, lllo) are little-endian:
  the first element is "1" (true).
* If we have both binary and hex variants, will the hex be big endian,
  and will the binary variant be understood by users to be big endian?

So maybe we should convert big-endian hex integers to blists.
Less confusing when porting code.

Problems with a nat -> blist conversion function (alternative to literals):
* You have to separately specify the size of the resulting blist.
  The literal syntax incorporates the size in the number of digits.
* Won't work for 64 bit blists because ints are 53 bits.
  So then maybe I need bignums, like 42n in javascript?
  * I don't like the Javascript semantics. There should not be 2 kinds of
    integers with different arithmetic properties.
    How about this: there are two internal number representations:
    64 bit floats, and bigints. A float that represents an integer whose
    magnitude is < 2^53 has identical semantics to a bigint with the same
    value.
  * Adding bigints is way too big a change to be justified by the problem
    presented here.

I like the syntax #1110, it solves a useability problem with the
syntax {#true,#true,#true,#false}. Hex blists have unresolved problems.

I'm not sure about using 0 and 1 to represent #false and #true.
It looks like this should be a list of binary digits.
Any alternative would be incomprehensible, though.
Eg, #|||- instead of #1110.

Bits not Bools
--------------
Should the Boolean values be encoded as #true,#false or as 1,0?

In this proposal, the Boolean values are encoded by 1 and 0.
For compatibility, stdlib defines true=1 and false=0.
These values are called bits (type Bit).
A list of bits is called a bit string.

Rationale:
  A 'bit' is a binary digit (0 or 1): the basic unit of computer storage and
  the basic unit of information in information theory. A 'Boolean' is a truth
  value (true or false, sometimes written 0 or 1). From Wiktionary.
  Mathworld says: "two-valued Boolean algebra (whose members are most commonly
  denoted 0 and 1, or false and true)".

  Should bits and Booleans be kept separate, with disjoint encodings, or should
  they be unified?
  * Algebraically, all of the operations of Boolean algebra (and, or, not, xor)
    apply equally to bits.
  * In addition, there are bit string operations like `bshift` and `bsum` which
    are not Boolean operations.

Benefits:
* Iverson has shown that there are useful idioms involving arithmetic
  on truth values, when encoded as 1 and 0. These are useful in pure
  math (the original context where Iverson developed these ideas), as well as
  in programming. Knuth endorses the idea and demonstrates some of the idioms.
* If truth values are represented by an abstract (non-numeric) boolean type,
  then there need to be conversions between bits and bools.
* If truth values are represented by bits then these conversion functions
  are not needed. Also, by not providing two different encodings of
  truth values, we don't force people to choose between the encodings.
* The bit literals 0 and 1 are single characters. This makes a big difference
  in the notation of bit strings. Compare [#true,#true,#true,#false]
  with [1,1,1,0].
* The term 'bit string' is widely used and understood.
  The word 'bits' is used in bit string operations.
* We'd like a compact representation (1 bit per value) for Boolean strings
  and bit strings. This is simpler if Boolean and Bit have the same encoding.

Drawbacks:
* When a function returns 0 or 1, you can't see by looking at the printed
  value whether it is intended to be a truth value.
* It's more work in the SubCurv compiler to deduce which variables should
  have type bool.
* It's more work to export booleans to JSON (need a schema).
* -0 == false? Is -0 a bit, accepted by boolean ops?

The syntax #1110 can be introduced as an abbreviation of [1,1,1,0], but
the need is less urgent than with the #true,#false encoding of truth values.

Replace
    bool32_to_float  float_to_bool32
    bool32_to_nat
    nat_to_bool32
with
    bits_to_float32  float32_to_bits
    bits_to_nat or bits_to_num or num
    'nat_to_bits n' or 'bits n'
