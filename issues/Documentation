My feedback from Wink is that the documentation needs to be improved.
 
 * There is an overview that explains all of the basic concepts, for people
   with a little mainstream imperative programming experience, but no
   functional programming experience.

 * Not just a reference manual, do a better job of explaining important
   concepts and ways of thinking, especially in areas where Curv is different
   from mainstream languages.

   Task based documentation, more than just a reference manual.
    * Libraries

 * All examples should be "executable code". If I show REPL sessions,
   that may satisfy the requirement.

     I'd like syntax colouring for REPL sessions. Colour the prompt,
     the input, and the output, differently. Likely impossible for the
     default *.rst viewer in the github code browser. But if I put the
     documentation on the Curv web site I can provide a better presentation.

 * Later: Book of Shaders is a model for interactive documentation: BookOfCurv
