Add a sign function.
It returns -1 for negative numbers,
1 for positive numbers,
and 0 for zero.

What is sign(-0)? This is holding me up.

 0. sign(-0) == -0
    from Julia. pure genius.
    ensures that: abs n * sign n <=> n
    and also ensures that: if sign n == 0 then n == 0
    However, it doesn't extract the sign bit.

 1. sign(-0) == -1
    axiom: abs n * sign n <=> n
    related to: signbit() in C++, which distinguishes 0 and -0

 2. sign(-0) == 0
    same as: sign in numpy
