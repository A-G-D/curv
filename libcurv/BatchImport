The `curv filename` command should use curv::import() to read the file.
This way, directory files, and future import file formats like images,
will work.

Problem:
* The code needs a Program later on. (We don't create a Program to import
  a directory, and there's no way to do it.)
* The Program is needed to pass as an argument
  * to At_Program(prog), which needs prog.sstate_, prog.nub()
  * to Shape_Program(prog), which needs prog.sstate_, prog.phrase_
  * to GPU_Program(prog), which needs prog.sstate_, prog.phrase_

Refactoring.

Refactor: use Source_State instead of [System, file_frame] pair
+ in Scanner
- in to_operation()
- in At_Token
- in At_Phrase
