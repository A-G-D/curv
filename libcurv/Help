Progress on the REPL 'help' command. Which I am debugging into existence.
=========================================================================

TODO List
---------
curv> help print
ERROR: Argument to 'help' is not an expression
1| help print
        ^^^^^
Add help for metafunctions.

> help rotate
* good: it prints both parameter signatures.
* bad: 'rotate' is no longer a named function. Need 'func' or 'def' keyword.
* bad: no docstring.

> help cube
* bad: just dumps the record, looks like gibberish.
* it's a shape, so print the shape description.
* it's a function, so print the function interface.
* it's a record, so print the description of each field?
