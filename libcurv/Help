Issues for the REPL 'help' command
==================================
Code Duplication:
  I now have duplicate documentation, between docs/language and libcurv/*.cc
  This needs to be resolved.

Curried Functions:
  What documentation is shown for a partially applied function?
  We don't have 'argument dependent documentation', where arguments are
  inserted into the documentation. It's too complicated to write generic
  documentation for the base function, and then to also allow this
  documentation to be specialized for argument values. Instead, we have static
  documentation for named API values, and in the partial application case, we
  show the partial argument list.

Builtin functions:
  Implement same print_help API as for builtin metafunctions.

Modules:
  Show name and 1-line summary of each field. Anonymous modules can have
  documented fields.

Rotate (case study)
-------------------
> help rotate
Function 'rotate':

rotate angle shape
  Rotate a 2D or 3D shape around the Z axis, counterclockwise, by an angle
  measured in radians.

rotate {angle, axis} shape
  Rotate a 3D shape around the specified axis, counterclockwise, by an
  angle measured in radians.

> help rotate (tau/4):
Function 'rotate 1.5707963267948966':

rotate angle shape
  Rotate a 2D or 3D shape around the Z axis, counterclockwise, by an angle
  measured in radians.

rotate {angle, axis} shape
  Rotate a 3D shape around the specified axis, counterclockwise, by an
  angle measured in radians.

Currently, rotate is printed as 'match _'. What is 'help rotate' now?
> help rotate
Function match [
  a :: is_num -> shape ->
  {angle, axis: a} -> shape ->
]

I guess we should show the 'match' documentation.
> help match
match : pattern matching conditional expressions

match function_list
  match[f1,f2,...] constructs a new function f whose argument can match any of
  the parameter patterns in [f1,f2,...]. To evaluate f x, check if x matches
  the parameter pattern of f1. If so, return f1 x. If not, continue with the
  remaining functions in the list. If no function accepts the argument x,
  then the pattern match for f x fails.

TODO List
---------
> help rotate
* good: it prints both parameter signatures.
* bad: 'rotate' is no longer a named function. Need 'func' or 'def' keyword.
* bad: no docstring.

> help cube
* bad: just dumps the record, looks like gibberish.
* it's a shape, so print the shape description.
* it's a function, so print the function interface.
* it's a record, so print the description of each field?
