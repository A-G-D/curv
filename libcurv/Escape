Special Character Escape Sequences
==================================
Within a quoted string, how do you escape $ and "
Within a symbol/quoted id, how do you escape $ and '

Current design: $. -> $ and $` -> quote (" or ' depending on context).
Also:
* Within a string lit, $ is only magic if followed by punct or alpha.
* Within a quoted id, $ is only magic if followed by punct.
* When printing string or symbol, output bare $ when context allows.
Rationale: less clutter from escaping when printing strings and symbols.
Eg, dollar character is printed as char "$"

Within string literals or quoted identifiers, $ followed by a punctuation
character is an escape sequence, and you get an error for an unknown escape
sequence:
    ERROR: Unknown escape sequence
    $ followed by a punctuation character is an escape sequence.
    $@ is an unknown escape sequence.
    Usage: $. means $ and $` means "
This error provides room for future expansion, and forces old code to be
updated to the new syntax, but it also helps eliminate ambiguity and maintain
the visual clarity of character/escape sequence boundaries.

History of Proposals
--------------------
All the alternatives have problems. Escaping impairs readability.

Compare 1 and 5:
    print "x=$x";
 1. "print $`x=$.x$`;"   char "$`"
 5. "print ""x=$$x"";"   char """"
    "print ${quot}x=${dol}x${quot};"

With #1, the boundaries of the escape sequences are visually clear, and
repeated escaping has linear growth. It's hard to reconstruct original text.
With #5, it is easier to see the original text, but hard to see escape
boundaries without character counting, and repeated escaping has exponential
growth.

Then there are the various "raw" string literal syntaxes that avoid escaping.
No best design, just tradeoffs between different kinds of readability, and
complexity of the syntax.

Newest to earliest:
1. $./$`
  $. is $
  $` is quote (" in a string, ' in a symbol)
  Note: meaning of $` is context sensitive.

    "print $`hello, world$`;"
    "print $`x=$.x$`;"
    char "$`"

2. $./$^/$`
  $. is $
  $^ is "
  $` is `
  All 3 are available in any context, for consistency.
  Note: $` is the absolute best escape for ' because `/' are so similar.
  Also because, in technical languages, ` is only ever used as a quote
  character, so it registers as a quote (for me).
  Far better than $| or $-
  $^ for " is not as good, but stylistically/visually similar (if you squint).
  These sequences "jump out" better than $#/$|
  But ^ registers for me as exponentiation or something, not as a quote.

    "print $^hello, world$^;"
    "print $^x=$.x$^;"
    char "$^"

3. $./$#/$|
  $. is $
  $# is "
  $| is '

    "print $#hello, world$#;"
    "print $#x=$.x$#;"
    char "$#"

  If you just look at the tops of the characters, #->" and |->'
  All 3 are available in any context, for consistency.
  $ and # are both full height characters so $# doesn't visually "jump out"
  if beside other full height characters.

4. $./$=/$-
  = is " lying on its side, ditto for - and '

    "print $=hello, world$=;"
    "print $=x=$.x$=;"
    char "$="

  All 3 are available in any context, for consistency.
  Easier to visually parse because $ only occurs at the start of an escape.
  Grows linearly under repeated escaping: " -> $= -> $.= -> $..=
  Not very mneumonic: = and - look like algebra, not like quotes.

5. $$/""/''
  $$ is $   not needed in symbol, where $ is literal
  "" is "   only available in string
  '' is '   only available in symbol/quoted id

  Doubling is a simple and natural rule.
    "print ""hello, world"";"
    "print ""x=$$x"";"
    char """"
  
  Looks good in non-adverse situations.
  Hard to visually parse for repeated characters, because then you have to
  count characters. Eg, three dollars is $$$$$$
  Grows exponentially under repeated escaping: $ -> $$ -> $$$$ -> $$$$$$$$

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
print "hello, world";

print $`hello, world$`;     -- better than $^

print $^hello, world$^;

print $``hello, world$``;

In a quoted string, use the $`` escape.
* In this context, $` not followed by another ` is an error (unknown escape).
  So you can't use $` in a string, only in a symbol.
* Or, $` not followed by another ` is a ' character. But if you want
  to encode '` what do you do (in a symbol literal)?
  So you can't use $`` in a symbol, only in a string.
 
So maybe it is simpler if $` means the quote character in either context.
The downside is that it doesn't have a fixed meaning independent of context.

String/Quoted Identifier Escape Sequences
* pronounceable literals for printable characters: "a"@0 == char #a
  The apostrophe and dollar characters are special cases.
  For dollar: change quoted identifier syntax so that '$' is legal.
   * Okay, #'$' is legal. But it prints as #'$.', and [#'$'] prints as "$.".
  For apostrophe: char 39, apos, char #'$-', "'"@0. I chose char 39, simple code.
  Should newline be printed as char 10 or as nl?
  * 'Char' is an abstract type whose values print as constructor expressions.
    So it is consistent to print apostrophe and newline as apos and nl.
  Brainstorming:
  #''' and #'$' are not legal syntax.
  * Use char 39 and char 36 for these cases.
  * Use dol and apos.
  * Use #'$-' and #'$.' but WTF syntax.
  * Revise symbol syntax to make this less brutal?
    For dollar:
    * #'$' is legal syntax. People will naturally assume this works.
      * maybe $ is not magic in a quoted identifier.
      * maybe $ is literal if followed by '
    For apostrophe:
    * #'''' is an apostrophe?
    * #''' is legal syntax? How do we know the quoted identifier ends at the
      third apostrophe?
    * #"'" -- double quoted symbols
      It doesn't generalize to quoted identifiers, though.
    * Markdown style escaping for `foo` type code literals.
      The Markdown syntax provides no way to write a zero-length code literal.
    * Any weird syntax I chose for escaping apostrophe in a quoted identifier
      will be weird.
    * Use "'"@0
    * So far, my experience is that char #'a' is weird and complicated syntax
      for a character literal. Lots of parts to remember and type in the
      correct order. Maybe use a simpler syntax?
  char #'a'
  char "a"  Simpler, less confusing. No new syntax involving non-standard
            arrangements of punctuation characters.
            However, `char` is vectorized, so logically it should be given
            a scalar argument to construct a scalar character.
            Actually, this works. A single-element string is distinct from any
            other valid argument.
  $a        Erlang. Space, newline encoded as $\s $\n.
  \a        Clojure. \space, \newline
            idea: In a string literal, $\x escapes x literally.
                "hello" ==> "$\"hello$\""
  @"a"      @x is the first element of list x.
Rethinking escape sequences.
* Better escape sequences for " and '
    $# is "    The top of # is "
    $| is '    The top of | is '
  See how this looks:
    "hello world"  "$#hello world$#"
                   "$=hello world$="
    #'This isn$|t C.'
    #'This isn$-t C.'
* Within string literals or quoted identifiers, $ followed by a punctuation
  character is an escape sequence, and you get an error for an unknown escape
  sequence.
    ERROR: Unknown escape sequence
    $ followed by a punctuation character is an escape sequence.
    $@ is an unknown escape sequence.
    Usage: $. means $ and $| means ' and $# means "
* Within a quoted identifier, $' means $ at the end of an identifier.
  $ followed by non-punctuation is a literal $, so eg '$42 is too much'
  contains no escape sequences.
* When a quoted symbol is printed, ' is escaped as $| and $ is only escaped
  as $. when it is followed by a punctuation character.
* Within a string literal, $" means $ at the end of the string.
  So "$" is a single-character string and char "$" is the printed rep
  for the dollar character.
  $ followed by a non-punctuation and non-letter character is a literal $
* char "$#" is the printed rep for the " character.
  Or 'quot' or 'char [quot]' or 'char "$quot".
  But be consistent when printing a string value as a string literal.
